They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!

I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.
20990,B002QWP89S,A3VVIU4JE56U4K,P. Chevalier,1,1,5,1314316800,Kinda Pricy but good!,"If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product."

So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth."

He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears."

I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon."

I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door."

Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe."

I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else."

They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product."

I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!

I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids.

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy ""smile"" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container."

A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much."

Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."

The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.

Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.

The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix."

Sometimes, though, the base can be difficult to screw back on after filling it with kibble.<br /><br />I have used the toy with my 8-month-old, medium-sized dog 3 times now, putting her kibble meal inside instead of treats. The first time she used it, she was frustrated and confused, and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while. The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left! This surprised me that she was so quick, but a similar thing happened when I introduced her to the Kong. It was quite hard the first time; but, after that, she seemed to have easy success."

We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory, there are many times we just can't sit and feed him his kibble bit by bit. We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution."

The outgoing one LOVES banging this toy around the house for hours. The shy one won't go near it. the first day with this, I filled it up almost full with kibble so it dispensed more easily, but she still got frustrated trying to figure out how to use it. After a couple of days, she can empty 1/2 cup of kibble from the small one in an hour :) and will continue to play with it as long as it has food in it.... the larger the treat size, the harder it is to come out. A couple kibble falls out every minute or so; a treat the size of a Zuke's Mini Bakes will come out every 5 to 10 minutes. I put 1/2 cup kibble and 10 mini bakes inside to keep her occupied for an hour. Note: the more full the jug is, the faster the dispensing rate (good for unmotivated dogs). The smaller the jug, the more full it is when a given amount of food is placed in it, thus if my pug had a hard time with the small size, I would buy the x-small so she could get the food out more easily. After a week of using it, I realize the small size is just fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />dog loves it<br />durable<br />keeps them occupied for unlimited time<br />i like the ""difficulty"" level of this toy: it is not too easy that it's emptied in 15 minutes like a treat ball, but not so hard that she won't play with it<br /><br />cons:<br />rope is difficult to clean and attracts moisture<br />the noise as she bangs it around the house is insane"

After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.

She's not terribly food-motivated in general, but she adores this toy, and we've taken to giving her one of her 2 daily meals out of the 'food bomb.' She seems to love working to get all the food bits out of it, and when that's done she alternates between gnawing on the screw top end of the toy, chewing on the rubber bit, and whipping it around by the rope.<br /><br />That brings me to the only potential drawback of the food bomb--I am convinced one of these days she's going to give me a concussion if she loses her grip on the rope while she's flinging it about. But since she has those strong pit bull jaws, hopefully that won't be an issue... Sometimes I'm shocked she hasn't given *herself* a concussion with it, but her head is apparently made of concrete.<br /><br />(Oh--and it has withstood a year's worth of her efforts to destroy it so far, which is more than I can say for the vast majority of toys that enter the house.)"

She needs about 20 minutes to empty the jug.<br />3) So far ( after 9 months ) no problems with breakage or chewage. This could be because we always set it out on the hall carpet, so it bangs less on the hardwood!"

At first she didnt know where to get the treat out, but within 30 minutes she figured it out! It keeps her occupied and gives us a break for about 30min-1hr at a time. She loves it! Since she's not a big dog, I dont see her chewing this up quickly. I was doubtful, but I highly recommend this!"

I had gotten another bottle, but the larger one.  THAT bottle was the same size as the dog.

21793,B000KV61FC,A1WSNXYC7HF73D,Erin,1,1,5,1313798400,"Took a while to figure out, but great toy!","I got the medium/large size about 2 weeks ago for my 2 year old, 40lb dog. He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor."

It dispenses his kibble just often enough that he stays interested, but not so quickly that it's empty in a few minutes.

21796,B000KV61FC,A9LPTAHI1WY9J,starwynn,1,1,1,1311033600,Not very busy buddy,"I purchased this toy for my very busy-mouthed blue heeler who seems to love everything that is half-way chewable.  It seemed to be the perfect combination of things he adores:  rope, bottles, noise, and chewable plastic.  We bought treats, showed him the treats inside (and they were good and stinky - his favorites), swung the thing around in the air a couple of times.  He was very interested, and we thought ""this is it!"".  We tossed the toy in front of him.  He smells it, pawed it once, and then nothing.  OK, that's fine.  Sometimes toys take a little warm up period.  So we grabbed it up, acted like it was great fun, teased him with the rope, tossed it, ran to get it, and did all the things that usually get our heeler into a playing frenzy.  Oh, he was ready to play.  But when he'd run to the toy - that was it.  ""Oh - it's still this toy, huh?""  Nothing.  We tried multiple times - nothing.<br /><br />This toy has all the makings of a good toy, but just didn't hit the mark.  It's very durable - because it will never get played with!  What a shame, too, because it's a great looking toy.  For a dog that loves just about every toy, he doesn't like this.  Two paws down."

The only complaint I have and the reason I have bought three is the threads where you screw the top on is a little easy to strip and break.  Could just be because my dog is a little rough on it, but I still love it and so does she."

Just looking at it, I figured there was no way they could figure out how to get the treats out.  I planned on giving it to my son who has bigger more active dogs.  Well, I put treats in one and put it down and one of my dogs took possession of it and worked for an hour at getting the treats.  She absolutely loves this toy, and will perk up and follow me when I pick them up to fill.  Yes, I kept both of them, just in case the other dogs took an interest.  Paws up on this one!!"
21799,B000KV61FC,A2HRGWAAMXYUS1,nycnic,1,1,3,1305504000,Great Toy but Not as Durable,"We got this for our 45lb dog and it occupied him for 30 minutes the first time we gave it to him. He had a little trouble getting a treat out. A miracle! However he is a smart dog and quickly learned how it worked. A scoop of food that used to last him 20+ minutes now only lasted him 10 minutes. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks, the plastic lid that screws onto the jug cracked and it is now useless. This is probably best for pet owners with carpeting since my dog would pick it up and drop it constantly to get the treats out which would be very noisy."
21800,B000KV61FC,A26HN4UMQCFF6U,Andie,1,1,5,1305331200,So much better than a bowl!,"The Tug-a-Jug has become our Hobbes' favorite toy.  We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night."
21801,B000KV61FC,AAXQSP6DYEBEW,tf0588,1,1,5,1303603200,Favorite toy,"I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars."
21802,B000KV61FC,A2DNCSRWGV1QE1,jean Lovejoy,1,1,1,1303257600,Great while it lasted,My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end  ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them.  You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food.  The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces.  The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure.  Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.
21803,B000KV61FC,AVBR6EYD2CVYP,Mollie Brown,1,1,2,1301961600,My Dogs completely ignore it.,"I purchased this for my dogs. One is a male 13 yrs old sharpei/golden retriever mix, another is a female 4 yrs old black lab, and the other is a 1 yr old great pyrenees. All of them ignore it completely! They seem to like the kong with treats in it best or the buster cube or a toy similar. However my sister's dog is a mix of german shepard and she loves this toy. So it kind of depends on the dog. Some dogs love it, some dogs ignore it."

They love to tear and chew anything up!  This is a great toy as it is durable, but also keeps them busy for hours trying to remove the treats.  It is adorable watching them try to figure out the rope\treat technique.  I ended up buying another one so they didn't have to share.  The best part is we have owned it for a couple of weeks and it is still in one piece!"
21805,B000KV61FC,A3UKWQS8SRW6IO,TropicalMinnesota,1,1,4,1300233600,Favorite toy - just plan to replace it frequently,"My puppy loves this toy, although I don't like that the rope gets smelly and it is hard to clean (I prefer toys that can go in the washer or dishwasher).  I put her kibble in it and she immediately hauls it into her crate she she can get the food out without having to chase it around the house.  She is not a toy chewer, but this has cracked just from her dropping it a few inches.  I have glued it several times, but the last time was so bad that the glue has now made it so I can't screw the bottom on.  This has lasted 1 month with a very gently now 5 month old Newfoundland. Not a great track record, but she loves it so much that I will order another. Thank God for Amazon Prime where I can get another one quickly as she looks disappointed when I put her food in her dish rather than this device."

He drains it pretty quickly, but we fill it with kibble thats different than his standard so its not too many treats.  Its fun to watch him play with it as well, since you can see him focus and think about it.  I recommend this to someone with a puppy that loves to think and do things."
21807,B000KV61FC,A296L8EY2F5A7T,AMC,1,1,5,1300233600,Puppy Loves It!,"My large Labradoodle puppy loves this toy.  He quickly figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him busy for a few minutes so that he is not chewing things that he shouldn't be!  The only downside is that it makes a lot of noise on the floors; but that's OK since he is a happy boy with this toy."
21808,B000KV61FC,A2RZAIJD4SEV6Z,Anne,1,1,5,1299283200,Challenging and Durable,"I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for ""aggressive chewers"" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)"
21809,B000KV61FC,AQQH4FCN0UPZV,DC Cathnstella,1,1,4,1298505600,Great for smart busy dogs!,"I have a 2 year old border collie mix who gets bored easily and loves interactive toys. She gets so excited when I bring this toy out. However, she is a very strong chewer so she was able to chew through the rope within a day or so. I read on the Busy Buddy website a great suggestion: put a tennis ball in the bottle to make the toy useful again. This has worked well and makes the treats a challenge to get out. She figured it out very quickly but she is also a very smart and curious dog. My only complaint is that it is very loud on the wood floors! this toy is best if you have carpet or at least don't have a basement tenant in your house."

Bridges,1,1,4,1298505600,Keeps dog busy,"Dog broke the hard plastic the first day by slamming it around by the rope so we have to tape it up everytime we refill. Dog does enjoy, carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent breakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him."
21812,B000KV61FC,A12HTYUARQWN3P,Hannah,1,1,4,1297987200,Good for fast eaters,"I put my dog's kibble meals in this so she doesn't gobble it up so fast.  She seems to think it's fun, and will work until she's gotten every last piece out.  I've had one for about a year and it's still in good condition except the rope is gross, so I wanted to replace it.  I ordered the small, which is pictured with a rubber piece instead of rope (thought it would be easier to clean), but I received a small with rope.  I definitely recommend this product as an alternative to the ""slow down"" bowls or for dogs that need extra stimulation.  I have a medium sized, non-destructive dog and this product does hold up over time."

However by 9 months old she figured it out and loves it! I give her kibble in here about 3-4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from breakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it - like mine does, it could definately break something. This is a great, durable toy at $11.92."

My 60 lb. mostly Dingo mix's strategy is to pick it up by the bottle and let it drop on the rope. When the rope hits the ground a few kibbled treats are released.

They quit playing with their other toys and carry these around with them.  I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.

They are tied for time to get all the treats out!<br /><br />This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors - too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs.

Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs, my sister had a 4lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the medium/large size toy.  My dogs are a 25lb cocker and a 35lb mix so I cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs.  If the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it.  Also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so I don't mind."

Definitely one of the better interactive toys within it's price range.  The dog is supposed to pull the rope to get the treat out.  Well, my boy bypassed all that and within 20 minutes figured out he just had to tip the bottle to get the treats out.  I put bigger treats in to keep him busy for longer and some pieces I still don't know to this day how he got them out before I got home from work.  My only gripe with this toy, which is something the instructions don't tell you, is that the rope starts to stink after a while.  I cleaned it with dish soap a few time but that was only a temporary fix.  Put the rope in the washer and it frayed and came loose.  I'm now using and old medium width leash that I cut and knotted up on both ends (small enough to still let the treats out but not to have him spill all at once), which will also be easier to wash since I don't have to worry about fraying.

The only problem I've encountered is that one of the ropes fell apart.

I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.  When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has.  Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day."

It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it.  Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy.

I started out by really filling the bottle and using smaller treats that would more easily dispense, and once he got the hang of it, used larger treats for increased challenge.  While the tassel on the end of tug rope has been worse for the wear, the rope has withstood Max's chewing well.  Max has been able to figure out various ways of getting to the treats--rolling the bottle around, up-ending it, then knocking it over and tugging on the rope to dispense the treats...As the label says, Max is able to smell, see and hear the treats, and this keeps him interested for hours of play.  I've learned however, that I really have to screw the bottom on extra tightly, as on one occasion he somehow managed to loosen it by repeatedly rolling the bottle, and was able to get to all the treats at once! Suffice to say, he did not have much of an appetite for his evening meal after that!!

Peyton,1,1,5,1250208000,Great toy to leave with my dog!,"I bought this toy and the buster cube to be able to leave with my dog on the couple of days he is home alone so that he at least gets a little excitement.  He absolutely loves it, and I recommend it to anyone.  I bought mine before they 'upgraded' to a rubber rope part, but he has only gotten the knot open once so it's not a problem.  It dispenses food quickly enough to keep him interested, and even once he's done eating he still likes to chew on the rubber and rope a little.  I think it was definitely worth the money and recommended it to our local vet who is now carrying it in stock."

It took him less than two days to become proficient with it. After about two weeks we stuck this nubby football toy sold at Complete Petmart in the bottle to slow him and keep him busy longer. It's just the right size to fill the bottle yet allow food to flow down. We do shake it a bit to get the flow started. Using this method it takes him about and hour and half to get all of the food out. He still gets to inhale his food and pester us sometimes it depends on what we're doing. I'd reccomend it and the nubby football to go inside if you have extra smart dog. If you google football dog toy in google images you will come across an example of the type of toy we used.

The bottom has pin size air holes so the dogs can smell the food, the bottle is tinted purple but you can still easily see the food and hear it rattle inside.  The plastic rope part has a 'plug' at the end so if the dogs try to pull the rope, it closes the top exit and food wont come out.

If you have a smaller breed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it.

We kept it out, though, and when he finally figured out his own system of getting dog food out of the jug, he was hooked!  Then we started putting all his meals in the jug instead of in his bowl.  Since starting his meals in the jug, Moby has an outlet for his curious energy and he spends less time in the trash can and in distructive activities like toilet paper shredding because he has to work physically and mentally for his meals like animals do in the wild.  It also occupies him while we aren't at home.  It lasts so much longer than a kong, because you can put a whole meal in it.  This is also great because you don't have to feel guilty about giving your dog too many unhealthy treats -- dog food in the jug works great because the kibble is the perfect size.<br /><br />I was watching the video of the woman who put in a negative review, and as an amateur dog trainer, I think I know why.  If you help your dog get food out of the jug, they quickly learn that the way to get food out of the jug is to bring it to the owner, so don't help your dog -- that ruins the fun of the toy!  Also, it's harder to get treats out of the toy if it isn't somewhat full, so just fill it up with dog food and a few treats in the beginning so it's not so difficult that the dog looses interest.  It also helps to put a few treats in the jug so they randomly hit a jackpot when playing with it.  As someone who's studied animal behavior, I know random rewards are the most powerful way to get an animal addicted to a behavior!<br /><br />In short, I can't say enough about this toy!"

He makes sure to get our attention while he's maneuvering it to get at the food, he seems very proud of his accomplishment whenever he gets the pieces to come out.  He gets very creative with different tactics.<br /><br />Five stars across the board, the tug-a-jug has become absolutely indespensable to us!"

Here are my issues with it.<br /><br />1) My dog may only be 16 lbs., but she's an extreme chewer. The product says it's durable, but it's not. She almost had it chewed through by day one.<br /><br />2) Apparently, my dog is a genius. She figured out how to dispense the treats, just not the way they're supposed to be dispensed. She unraveled the rope. Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.<br /><br />I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats.

The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable.

The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)"

At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces.

The rope is a weak point. I understand the theory that the dog is supposed to use the rope to chuck the bottle around and have the food come out, but after a couple of days our collie picked the toy up, took it across to her bed, and started determinedly chewing through the rope.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends you put the plastic practice golf balls in the jug instead of the rope, and this worked for a while, but then our dog started chewing the purple ball off the end of the bottle, and when she'd got sufficiently through that, managed to crack the neck of the bottle itself.<br /><br />We got her a replacement (as it took some weeks for her to crack the first bottle) and this time the rope lasted less than two days. So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.<br /><br />The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.<br /><br />1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.<br /><br />2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.<br /><br />Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray."

He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat.

My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!"

From dragging it around the living room to standing it up by the couch and knocking it back over. Also keeps his interest for a very long time whether it has treats in it or not!!!! I would recomend this to keep your canine pal entertained.<br />My furbaby loves to have kibble or multi-grain cherios plus some biscuits in his!****<br /><br />*****5 months later and I had to write an update. Gizmo is still in love with this toy. He loves to pull it around and scratch on the bottle to see if he can get at the rope, lol. Does he play with it every day...no. But, he doesn't play with any of his toys everyday. I'm so glad that I bought this for him, it has been a great purchase. He still loves it and loves to play with it regardless of treats being in there or not. If your dog is active, smart, loves to pounce and dig this is a great toy option. Is every dog going to love it....no but you can't get a promise of that with any toy! I highly suggest you give this toy a try."

If we're going out for dinner, I put the dog's dinner portion of dry food (very small morsels) into the jug so he can play and eat while we're away.  I had been using empty bottles from bottled water for him, but they begin to splinter and break up after a couple of days and I worried about him swallowing broken bits of plastic (NOT good for the tummy!).  I don't have to worry about that with this VERY durable bottle.

Like one of the other reviewers, at first my dog was not entirely convinced that the toy was his to play with, as he had never been given access to a bottle before.  After the scent of the treats lured him in, he began to play.  It took little time for him to realize that the rope was what was getting in the way of the treating plopping out, so he just set about chewing on the rope until he succeeded in chewing it in half.  After this happened, the shorter knotted end fell into the jug, and the treats came out easily.  Now I am left with an -a-Jug, as the ""tug"" is missing.  We left the remaining 1/2 of the rope in the jug so that there would be some resistance to the treats just falling out.  A tennis balls works well too.  I'm hoping to find a replacement rope to string through the jug, however they are often knotted so tightly, I've not yet had any success there.  Overall, a great toy that continues to entertain my dog, despite the fact that he re-engineered the main mechanism in the first 30 minutes."

If they aren't, it probably is not the toy for your dog.<br /><br />At first, my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy.  It took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was ""his"".  Once I finally got him used to realizing it was his own, he saw me put his kibble in it.  Then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it.  Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.  I like interactive toys :)<br /><br />On the other hand, our little dog, still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy.  Just a guess, he probably never will figure it out.  So, some dogs will take to it, and others will look at you like you're crazy for giving them a toy that doesn't squeak!"

Other reviewers said their dogs got the hang of it quickly and were able to ""beat"" the system, but I don't see that happening with our dog.  It is still a bit of randomness with how the food comes out, so what worked for the dog one time, might not the next.

Bulldog mix) needed a lot of help getting the food out while the rope was intact, but after he shredded the rope after about two days of gnawing, everything changed.  I cut the inside knot off and left it inside the bottle so that it would slow down the exit of the kibbles.  So now the kibbles come out much easier, but not too easily.<br /><br />Bottom line, with this slight modification, my puppy LOVES his purple bottle, and the 10 minutes that he spends throwing the bottle around to get his food out is 10 minutes less that he's chewing on things that he shouldn't be or otherwise being naughty."

She never quite figured out the ""tug"" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the ""tug"" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think."

Second round she graduated to that plus nosing it up the rest of the way.  Third she figured out putting one paw on the rope helped her paw it upend with the other.  She's also lifted it up in her mouth, open end down. In defense of the toy, she previously learned to do this with kibble in Kongs so she may already understand ""things that if tipped upside down dispense treats"".<br /><br />She's a pretty smart dog but of course everyone thinks their kid is the smartest in the class :)<br /><br />I've read suggestions on adding balls to it to make it more difficult, which would slow her down, but I was hoping to be able to increase the mental challenge not just reduce the randomness, so this now is as ""difficult"" mentally as it'll get.<br /><br />She's completely ignored the rope except as a way to upend it.<br /><br />On the positive side, it does provide her mental challenge, slows down her otherwise rapid eating, and isn't so difficult that she gives up or gets frustrated.

But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated.

We fill this with Zukes or with crushed Nuturo choice snacks and leave it for her when we go to work. This can be a really long toy for your dog due to the small opening near the rope and it's good to check that what you put in will actually come out. Our dog gets her treats out be picking this up by the rope and then flinging it across the room (much to the chargin of the tenants below our apartment). She also just chews on the rope when she is bored and also tries to tug the rope back and forth in order to dislodge some of the treats. The best method for her however is to throw it and although it's durable, your wood floors may not like it and it can be somewhat noisy.

I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.<br /><br />Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball."
22005,B000KV61FC,A1RFDHX5W6HB74,W. Kepner,0,0,3,1296259200,OK toy if you remove the rope for safety..,"Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble."

It took her a few tries to get the hang of it, but now she rolls it around and has learned to put her paw on the bumpy part to tip the jug up and empty the food out. It works great with her kibble (eukaneuba adult maintenance small bites) but she goes crazy when I put her high-value treats in it like little pieces of string cheese.<br /><br />There are two down sides - one, since the rope never comes out, the part inside the jug gets kind of gross with all the food. its a little hard to thoroughly wash, but it can be done. Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to break the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in) - so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.<br /><br />I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything!

Because we knew he was going to be a bigger dog, we opted for the medium/large size, which for his current size, is a little big for him now.  But he manages fine with it, plus I like that he can't throw the toy in the air like he does with so many of his other toys.<br /><br />We've had this toy for about a month now and use it at least 4-5 times a week.  Initially, our dog was a little slow in understanding the concept and wasn't very interested in it.  But after a few days, he got the idea and now gets excited whenever he sees us filling it up.  We usually fill the container with a mix of his kibble and some cut up treats for a total of about a 1/4 of a cup and it keeps him occupied for about 30-45 minutes at a time.  We haven't tried adding balls to the jug yet to increase the difficulty, but we may do so soon.<br /><br />This toy has been a savior to help occupy him while we are busy trying to do things around the house, such as cook dinner or do laundry.  I also give it to him to prevent boredom as well as help get rid of some excess energy that he still may have at night since he will push, drag, and carry it all over the place as he is trying to get out the contents.  After a month of use, the only thing that has some signs of wear and tear is the rope.  Our puppy hasn't done any damage to the actual jug yet.<br /><br />On a side note, I have seen the smaller ones in the store that have rubber/plastic ropes, which do not seem to be very durable, but ours was an actual rope, as in the picture and has held up great with our dog.  We have been so pleased with this product, that we bought the smaller one for a family member's new puppy."

I have a Chihuahua-shaped vacuum cleaner of a dog who is utterly obsessive about food, and a neurotic Shep/Lab mix who will turn her nose up at food in a bowl, yet gobble up ""found"" food. These toys are the ideal solution for both dogs. The Chih works harder to get the food out (we have the med/large size jugs, so they're pretty big for him to manipulate), which means he's burning off calories. He tends to be a bit of a chub, so this is a good thing. The Shep/Lab mix has an easier time of it, but the toy keeps her occupied and she seems to enjoy it. I've just adopted another dog from the shelter, and gave her her own Tug-a-Jug. It's great for her b/c she has to stay crated a lot right now (healing from her spay surgery, plus the vet put her on very restricted activity while she recovers from an upper respiratory infection). I make sure to put the jugs away when I leave the house (don't want anyone fighting over food), but they're wonderful for when I'm working from home and need to keep the dogs busy while I'm on the phone with clients. (Murphy's Law of Dog Ownership #1: Your dog will bark like a freaking maniac - but for no discernible reason - the moment you get on the phone with the client you've been trying to reach for a week.)<br /><br />Our experiences with these toys have been great, so I heartily recommend them. My Chih has been determinedly trying to manipulate his jug into spitting out more food for the past 30 minutes, and his tail has been wagging the whole time."

For the treats to come out, the dog needs to pull on the rope and whip the bottle around. Because of the shape of the bottle, the kibble will not spill out on its own while lying on its side. I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby - the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.<br /><br />I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either - the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.<br /><br />On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.<br /><br />I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted - it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog."

She likes me getting food out for her, but never got into bouncing it around to figure out how to get food out herself. Two weeks later it is lying in a corner, ignored, full of yummy treats. I still think this toy has great potential, but I don't recommend it for a timid dog, that gets spooked easily. My dog loves her Kong chew toys.

Both dogs enjoy working their breakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.<br /><br />When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I ""primed"" the jug by spilling out a couple high-value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.<br /><br />The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.<br /><br />I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large-chested breeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time)."

Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).

I know a lot of people mentioned their dogs chew right through the rope, but this was not the case in our house, which I was glad to see.  They seem to focus on scratching at the purple spiked piece and don't do much flailing around by the rope, so that could be why.<br /><br />One of the dogs figured out how to use it right away, although it took her a couple of weeks to get a little more aggressive with it.  It took the other one almost a month to not be afraid of it!  It never fails, though, when they go for their toy box, this is the toy they pull out and play with for a good 20 minutes.

I got this last summer for my very anxious, smart 2 year old pit bull rescue to keep him occupied while working. He is very destructive to his toys but doesn't eat what he destroys. He spends an hour or more a day playing with it , not including while we aren't home. At first I fed him only from this toy, but now he's calmer so I feed him in his bowl too, but he generally prefers to feed out of the toy. I knew when buying he would chew the plastic rope off immediately, and he did. Some come with a nylon rope, which would take longer to chew off. Since I have the large, and the rope is gone, I put in one or more large treats (depending on how hard to dispense I want to make it) and regular size hard dog food and a few small treats that will fit through the neck. The rope definitely blocks well and can be replaced; for me it was easier to put a larger dog treat in to block. With the rope I needed to use small bite dog food because it came out very slowly, and he would lose interest.  Interestingly he loves the enlarged end of the plastic rope to chew on (not good for swallowers). Very sturdy and easy to fill as long as you line up the spirals. He's never opened it. He knocks it around with his paws and nose and grabs the neck with his mouth and throws it around. So far no damage, but it is sturdy and could possibly break something when tossed. Worth the slight risk. After almost 8 months he began to chew off the plastic ring around the neck, which he loved doing, and does attract him to the neck where the treats come out. Recently he started chewing the neck off, which is why I'm buying another, but I plan on using this one until he gets down to where the neck is gone, as it still works and he still loves it."

The advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good. In all, I like this toy, because it's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser, which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her.

I break up his hard biscuits and feed them through the top (the bottom screws off but if you put them through the top, you know they can fall out during play) and Walter flings it to the ground and rolls it around the get the treats to fall out. He loves it and it's almost always in his mouth. This is, hands down, his favorite toy. But, he's a smart dog and learned from a different toy (rubber ball with a hole in it) how to work treats out of a toy. You may have to demonstrate how it works to your dog."

Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.

After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I then purchased a replacement end of last year.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one.

I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that.

He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work."

We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time."

Sometimes Juneau would drop the KONG down a flight of stairs to get the treat. I didn't mind the rubber KONG bouncing around.

He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it.

I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.  He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any!  So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong.  He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.

He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber ""rope"" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt. It just gets dirty and hard to clean."

This is the best toy I've found yet to keep my overly smart dog challenged.<br /><br />I've used Kongs filled with loose kibble, then kibble mixed with yogurt, kibble mixed with cream cheese or peanut butter, then kibble mixed with one of those and frozen. After 2 months of increasingly challenging Kongs, my dog finally graduated to the point that Kongs don't keep her busy or engaged for long. I also had been filling the Premier Waggle with her kibble, and she takes care of those pretty quickly too and seems to have gotten bored of the one repetitive move she used to get food out.<br /><br />So I got the tug-a-jug. My dog figured out how to get food out right away, which was disappointing -- then I realized I could put big chunks of treats in there to make it smell enticing and harder for the smaller food kibbles to come out. It works!<br /><br />I love that you can customize how hard it is for your dog to get food out by putting in objects that are too big to come out. I filled about half the jug with freeze-dried liver. Then, I put about half a cup of kibble per meal. It takes my dog a good half hour to get out all her kibble, and she really seems to love shoving, nosing, and flinging the jug around. She used a greater variety of movements than with the waggle, which is probably more fun for her.<br /><br />I also love that the jug is SO easy to fill! Kongs and even the waggle are annoying because they have small holes you have to shove the treats into, but the entire bottom of the jug screws off so you can just scoop the food in. Fast and easy, and my dog is delighted. Totally worth the $."
22173,B000KV61FC,AWN8ZV815QHJF,R. Ross,3,3,4,1264377600,Better than the Buster Cube; almost as good as a bully stick,"We bought the ""small"" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats/kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the ""rope"" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug-a-jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation."

We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes."

She's easily bored, extremely destructive & likes puzzles. This looked perfect. It takes a bit of work to get food out so I knew this would occupy her for a while. The screw-on lid at the bottom of the jug was virtually seamless and very tight. When I ran my fingers over the seam before giving it to her I could barely feel it.<br /><br />I gave it to her at 8am before I went to work. I came home for lunch at 11:30 and she had COMPLETELY destroyed it! She located the seam and, somehow, wedged her teeth into it, worked her way around the circumference and pried the lid loose. She then chewed the lip off of the jug all the way around so the lid cannot be put back on it. She was lying there calmly and the food was all gone, so she had clearly long since finished all this in the 3.5 hours since I had given it to her."

Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue.

It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a ""competive eater"" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having ""intestinal turbulence"" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the ""easy meal"" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.

The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck.

One, I would never use it in a house with hardwood floors, especially if you are noise sensitive! The bottle is quite hard and it does create a lot of noise if your dog becomes on who picks it up and slams it on the floor, as one of mine does.  The other spins it around and as a result is a bit quieter.  There is also no way of regulating how fast treats come out of the jug.  Once the dogs learn the concept of the toy, most learn not to touch the tug, otherwise you restrict toys from coming out.  In terms of safety, I have not had my dogs try to eat the rubber tug handle or the ball at the top of the bottle.  The biggest problem I have with them is that of massive hair accumulation from the dogs dragging it all over the carpet."

The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the ""scent holes"" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately."

Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible.

He was a little hesitant of it at first but once he figured out that the toy dispensed food, he is having a great time figuring out different ways of getting his kibble to come out. It is also a very durable toy, which is what I was looking for. He is an aggressive chewer and has chewed through a lot of his other toys - even though he has tried to chew on the jug, he has not been able to inflict any damage to it so far (we've had it for about 3 weeks now). The Tug-a-Jug is made of very durable plastic. The bottom opens so you can fill the jug with kibble or treats and I was happy to find that it has extra threading so it screws on very firmly and stays on even with my dogs wild play with the jug."

For most dogs it's GREAT (I've fostered dogs and have my own).  I have both the small and medium sizes, which actually both work well for my 50 pound dog but I change them based on the size of kibble I feed.<br /><br />I like that they changed from the plastic-type ""rope"" which could easily be chewed and swallowed, but I don't like the new cotton rope - it's simply too difficult to clean and doesn't dry quickly enough.  I cut it off, purchased a piece of non-toxic acrylic rope, and have been satisfied (just have to tie the ends and burn them so they don't unravel).<br /><br />Kind of a pain to have to get a different rope and wish they would change it, but the replacement only cost me 50 cents.  The jug itself is more durable in the medium size than small, but I use it in a crate that has thick soft bedding now and has lasted almost a year so far.  When my dogs used it on hard floors the bottom of it cracked, although that was after 5 months.<br /><br />There were a couple very powerful chewers that managed to break the tops of these easily (I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M"">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLWJ1G"">Premier Busy Buddy Linkables Dog Toys Value Pack</a> for them).

My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking."

It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!"

My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.<br /><br />When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x/day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13-year-old Labrador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat-dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short-lived."

The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried, so I decided to purchase a second one. My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't ""play"" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding."

I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!

Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!"

We have been using the jug about 8 months and have stopped feeding our dog with the dog dish and now only use the Jug. It takes him several minutes to get his food out, keeps him entertained and he actually chews his kibble instead of inhaling everything in 10 seconds like he would do out of the dish. The jug can also be filled with treats and is a great tool for dogs with attachment issues. For example, our dog used to go nuts and tear up the house when we left, but now we fill the jug with kibble before we leave to keep him busy. It keeps his mind occupied long enough to forget about us leaving and as a result he no longer becomes destructive when we are away. If you have a dog that is too smart for his/her own good and needs a good toy to keep 'em busy then I would recommend the Jug hands down.

Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes ""how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?""  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.

I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good.

I started him by taking the rope plug out initially (this can easily by done by unscrewing the jug and pulling the plug through).  I lined the rim with peanut butter and put his meal inside.  He quickly learned that rolling it around and tipping it made it dispense food.  After a couple of days of this, I put the plug back in.  He now spends 1.5-2 hours a day trying to empty this thing.  When he's done, he collapses and sleeps.  It's a beautiful thing.  I feed him all his meals in it now and it's his favorite toy."

At first, it'd take her about 40 minutes or so to get all the food out (I put her kibble in it), but as she got the hang of it, it would only take her about 10 minutes.  I put a tennis ball inside the jar with the kibble to make it a little harder for her and now, on average, it takes her about 30 minutes.  She loves this toy and I love watching her toss around the jar and fiddling with the rope to get the kibble out."

The half of it that extends out of the jug that is meant for tugging was chewed off in about an hour. It did not crumble or flake though, which was a relief interms of safety. Thankfully, another reviewer had the same experience so I kept a close watch on this. The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.<br /><br />The other rubber/plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug/bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing! The dogs could care less that they can see the treats because they are too busy trying to stick their faces into the open end. This is not a noisy toy."

The thing is great--most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~!

However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber ""tug"" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.

They're both much more interested in playing than eating, but my vet was adamant that letting them graze all day would make house training significantly more difficult.<br /><br />The answer has been to make their eating more of a challenge. We've got two oversized Kongs that we'll fill with their breakfast, but they eat out of the kongs very quickly. In the evening, we needed something that would keep the puppies busy for at least ten minutes, so one of us could get some food in our own mouths before it was time for the pack to go out.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug has been great. Both puppies are challenged by it, but not so challenged that they lose interest. There's a perfect balance between work and reward. It holds a lot of food and assorted small treats, it's pretty easy to load, and the beasts haven't figured out how to unscrew the bottom lid.<br /><br />Some of the pictures for this product on various websites show a rope. Mine actually came with a silicone ""rope"" that's got a cone shape at the end, which ensures something gets scooped to the neck almost every time they pull on it.<br /><br />Only downside for my two is that if the food drops below a certain level they lose interest... might be because it's too much work, or it might be because they're full.

I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts.

A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary."

I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers.

I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next."

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)"

These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack.

She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.

And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!

We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes.

But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?"

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."

The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips."

So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."

My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal.

This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs.

They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!"

They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others."

I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!"

They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good."

With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume.

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

At first I thought they would be like Pringles,"" which I don't care for "" but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide."

I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light. They're air-popped instead of fried or baked and all-natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten-free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans-fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.<br /><br />1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1/3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.<br /><br />I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others. This one is my favorite. Highly highly recommended."

They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips.

They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, ""sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil."" Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil."

There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.

Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",0,1,5,1327708800,I loved them!,"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation."

The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty.

Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips."

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake ""healthier"" for ""healthy.""  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those ""truth in advertising"" points that annoys me so I mention it."

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

24239,B0013NUGDE,A2ZKS33N6Y3EPC,Tri Cao Nguyen,1,1,3,1326412800,"Taste more like ""Tomato and Basil"" than ""Chili and Lime""","NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now."

A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far.

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.

We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.

No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack.

They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.

She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.

The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn.

Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just ""different"" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety."

But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?"

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."

The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips."

So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."

This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs.

Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.

One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite ""chip""! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!"

They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others."

I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!"

I was wrong. They are light, airy, and have a great taste to them... (a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say ""harder"" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most. It has a nice kick to it (if you're not into heat, you might want to stay away from this flavor and stick with my other favorite 'original'... otherwise, just have a bottle of water nearby.) I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is a lover of chips."

I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."

At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.

31009,B007M83302,A1BCJRK9AO9GAX,"T. Master ""rocket nerd""",0,0,5,1289692800,Healthier alternative for chip fix,"In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar.

I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors."

Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.

When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor."

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.

They use heat and pressure to ""pop"" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a ""use by"" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips."

They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough."

Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues."

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake ""healthier"" for ""healthy.""  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those ""truth in advertising"" points that annoys me so I mention it."

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.

I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.
74639,B0026RQTGE,A3VVIU4JE56U4K,P. Chevalier,1,1,5,1314316800,Kinda Pricy but good!,"If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product."

So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth."

I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up.

Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting.

I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog.

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E.

If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids.

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time.

Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day.

Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."

A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.

The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.

However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an ""authorized vendor"".  ""Monster Pets"" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are ""authorized"".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an ""authorized"" vendor.

The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver.

My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them."

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies."

We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them."

It reminds me of the taste of Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino with the caramel flavoring. I made it hot and it was delicious. Then I made it with ice and it was even better!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy this flavor because I saw a negative review and it came in a 36 count package. I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this."

With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy.

I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked.

Since the coffee taste isn't too overpowering, it makes an amazing drink for a cold winter night. Perfect something to warm you up!<br /><br />P.S<br />Top it with some whip cream, DELICIOUS!"

Something has gone terribly wrong with this product.  I used to love it,  but now they are just terrible.  I don't know if they changed the formula or what the problem is, but there is a terrible after taste that never used to be there before.  I've heard other customers complain about it, but I had no idea what they were talking about.  I thought they were crazy.  Turns out they were right!  Not every cup, but at least 1/2 of the last shipment had cappuchino's cups that had a very bad after taste.  Why not all?  Can't tell you. When they taste bad they taste really bad and I found myself not even being able to finish.  I'm so dissapointed...."

Before my favorite coffee was from Starbucks, the Caramel Machiato.  But I absolutely LOVE this coffee.  I don't really care that it is instant, because I think it tastes really good.  My favorite thing is that on the medium Keurig setting I do not have to do a thing to it to enjoy it.  No sugar, no cream, no nothing.  Just pop the K-cup in, hit the button and enjoy.  If you are not a really big coffee snob and like sweet flavored coffees you might love this one, I do."

I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more ""real"" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)"

I clean my Keurig frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make.

I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!

No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good.

Some of the flavored K-cups are just that - flavored coffee - and you need to add your own cream or milk and sweeteners.  But this is all ready the minute it stops brewing!  To me - the entire concept of the Keurig is to have your favorite beverage ready instantly.  If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.  My only regret - I wish Grove Square would also make a Mocha K-cup.  That is another of our favorite coffee drinks.

I am still calibrating how much coffee should go in the container for brewing. One rather odd observation: There is not much vanilla fragrance when one opens the package; there is also not much of a fragrance when it is brewing. But when I drink a cup, the vanilla flavir is there.<br /><br />So, in the end, I find this a nice complement to my Keurig machine.

I drink one cup black in the morning and a second in the late afternoon with lots of Half-and-Half.<br /><br />As for this product, it's quite a pleasant coffee with no bitterness whatever. If found it to be especially delicate in ambiance, even though I intentionally brewed it just on the strong side. Had I used this extra amount of coffee with other gourmet brands that I've tried, it certainly would have been much darker and bolder (and in all liklihood, harsh) in taste.<br /><br />I was surprised in regard to the vanilla (a flavoring that I generally like) aspect of the coffee. The aroma of the grounds is pretty significant and I expected a similarly infused flavor in my cup; however, the vanilla came through as little more than a slight nudge. I actually would have preferred a more prevalent vanilla taste had I gone specifically for a vanilla-flavored coffee. But this facet of the blend might represent a positive point for certain other vanilla coffee lovers.<br /><br />Would I personally buy this product? If there were no such thing as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA"">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> then I could say with some confidence that I would buy some intermittently.

I was expecting something much more vanilla- like in flavor but the flavor is instead a little harsh, roasty, and contains only a touch of vanilla. How Starbucks managed to produce such an aromatic product that tastes so different, I am not sure.<br /><br />However, this isn't to say the product is bad. I find it decent as a general coffee for everyday consumption. I also like that Starbucks encourages recycling by offering a free cup of coffee if consumers bring the empty bag to a nearby Starbucks location. The coffee is responsibly grown and ethically traded, too, as indicated by the Starbucks Shared Planet symbol. However, the bottom- line is taste and based on the lack of real vanilla flavor, like I was expecting, I can give this product only an average rating overall."

I used less than that and it was way too strong (bitter to me), and yet the vanilla flavor was barely evident. I tried reducing it more and it was still bitter with no vanilla flavor.

This, however, is so you can taste the vanilla better. When compared to the Melitta vanilla coffee (which was also offered on Vine), this one wins hands down. The vanilla in the starbucks coffee is much milder than the melitta version which allows you to enjoy the coffee itself rather than being overpowered by the vanilla.

At a normal strength brew, I didn't find the after-taste itself to be the problem, but rather its persistence (for hours).  In stronger brews, the drink and the after-taste had a prominent burnt and acidic taste (a characterization often used by non-fans of Starbucks).<br /><br />My _awareness_ of the after-taste declined significantly in subsequent days.

However, in my opinion, many flavored coffees tend to be terribly overpowering to the point where I typically brew my flavored coffee with a 50/50 mix of flavored coffee to regular coffee.  Normally I brew my coffee with 1 tablespoon of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and use 1 packet of sugar per cup.<br /><br />I must admit that traditionally I am not a huge fan of Starbucks.  While they put out an excellent quality product, I think their beans tend to be over roasted.  However, I am the first to say it is still a decent cup of coffee.  So when I had the opportunity to try the Starbucks Natural Fusions line, I jumped on the chance.  When I received my bag of Starbucks Vanilla flavored coffee, I pulled out the coffee maker and brewed up a cup.<br /><br />The bouquet of the coffee grounds was a bit unusual.  There was a definite aroma of fine coffee beans, but there was an underlying odor that I can not place.  The ground coffee did not have a distinct vanilla aroma that I could detect.  The same was true with a brewed cup.  While there was a distinctive coffee scent, I still could detect the mystery scent which still did not smell like vanilla to me.<br /><br />The first sip resulted in an overpowering bitter flavor.  Having spent significant time in the Caribbean and South America, I am no stranger to the strong brewed coffees that are prevalent in some countries I have been to.  I am unsure of the source of the bitterness in the coffee (maybe the sarsaparilla root listed in the ingredients), but the bitter flavor was very significant.  The bitter flavor did become less noticeable with the more coffee I drank.  While I became accustomed to the bitterness, it never really went completely away.<br /><br />I really did not detect any vanilla flavor in the coffee, even when used at full strength.  In my opinion, the bitterness really detracts from any flavor of the coffee.  I am sure some people might love this aspect of the coffee, but for me it did not work.<br /><br />Overall, this did not seem to be a bad cup of coffee, but I just could not get past the overwhelming bitter flavor.  I would recommend this blend to people who like an intense, bitter flavor to their coffee.  If you prefer a milder cup of joe, then I would pass on this coffee.  I think this will be a wonderful product for the right person; however, that person just is not me.<br /><br />J. E. Nelson"

In any case, not only did this coffee taste bitter to me, but the vanilla taste was weaker than I expected (again, this is in comparison to another vanilla-flavored coffee I've had, which gave me a stronger vanilla ""experience""). This Starbucks product is pretty strong coffee (the instructions tell you to use 2 TBS of ground coffee for 6 ounces of water) and to my taste - seems quite bitter if I follow their instructions.

I generally don't drink coffee and I definitely don't pay $5 for a grande tall whatever the heck. Every once and a while though, I do like my coffee flavored desserts. For someone like me, you won't like this coffee.  For me all you can really taste is the Starbucks ""burnt"" flavor with a bit of vanilla flavoring. When I asked my friend to try this stuff, he said ""Yeah, tastes like old Starbucks.""  This particular Starbucks flavor comes pre-ground, which immediately starts the decay of the coffee's various oils and flavor notes. There's even a warning on the bag which recommends using the grounds within a week of opening the bag. This may not be an issue for most die-hard coffee drinkers, but for me, much of this bag will probably go to waste.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this Starbucks bagged coffee tasted like that flavor of beans at the local Starbucks that no one likes, so it's been sitting there for weeks. It's still very ""coffee"" in flavor, but slightly off, slightly milder, slightly weaker. While absolutely drinkable, it's not going to be like visiting a Starbucks."

The next pot I made I put in less coffee and it came out better, but still a little on the bitter side. I finally got so that I added 1/3 the amount of this coffee than I would my normal brand and it finally came out decent. Coffee is one of those things that is very individual to each person and their taste. What one person may not like, another might. If you like darker roasted coffee then this would be perfect for you. If you prefer a lighter roast, you may want to pass on this or do what I did and make it much weaker than you would your normal brand. The Vanilla flavor is ok, but I prefer another brand of Vanilla coffee (DD are the initials). Overall, not horrible, but not great and if given a choice between this and DD vanilla coffee I would pick DD. Again, this is just my personal preference and taste."

When this blend is sweetened, however, the vanilla changes to a caramel flavor, which may disappoint those looking to be overcome with the subtle sweetness and aroma of Vanilla.  This blend is best enjoyed either lightly sweetened or unsweetened at all, which may leave many outside the ardent coffee drinker crowd with a bitter tasting disappointment.

I also drank it alone with Stevia, which is an all-natural sweetener used by health conscious people.  The Stevia enhances the vanilla flavor but I prefer using the creamer.

The recipe (instructions) on the bag calls for 2 Tbsp (10g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) water.  My parents and I made it with 1 Tbsp ground coffee for every 6 fl oz.  The coffee still tasted great but it only had one-half the caffeine.<br /><br />  When I returned to work after the Thanksgiving holidays, I brewed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee using my Keurig Mini Brewer, which makes individual cups of coffee.  I scooped the Starbucks Coffee into the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.  I also used International Delight French Vanilla Creamer.  My vanilla coffee was excellent.

The coffee seems to burn slightly as it goes down, and tastes overly sweet even without any extra sweetener. I needed that second cup at 6:15 a.m. far more than I wanted it, and I will not be drinking this brew again except as iced coffee and even then, not without cutting it with some regular coffee to help constrain the cloying flavor that coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine."

Ok, I'm not a coffee master/aficionado/snob, but I know how I like my coffee: strong with cream and sugar.  Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.

So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.<br /><br />First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.<br /><br />In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.

Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that ""weird taste"" to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br /><br />I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br /><br />The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there."

I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor. So there you have it: Alone, it's a disappointing and practically unpalatable disaster; cut it with some average run-of-the-mill coffee and it can become pleasing enough to drink."

I found it impossible not to put the opened bag under my nose and inhale deeply! This wonderful aroma continued throughout the brewing process.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, medium in strength, with notes of mellow vanilla, an almost indiscernable hint of coconut, and a nutty finish. Like every flavored coffee, however, Starbucks Natural Vanilla requires some sort of sweetener to bring out its best flavors (at least for me). I tried a teaspoon of Stevia along with cream with my first cup. Meh. Added Coffee Mate Vanilla to the second cup, which was much better. But the best combination was achieved for me when I added Coffee Mate's Peppermint Mocha holiday creamer. That was the winning combination for me. This demonstrates that Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is really a dessert coffee.

They also say ""Enjoy with: A crumbly butter cookie (or two) and a pool of late-afternoon sunshine.""<br /><br />How well do they pull it off?  The coffee has a very strong aroma of vanilla, a lot like freshly baked cookies.  The flavor is a mixture of the traditional Starbucks taste with an equal amount of vanilla.  For me, the two tastes do not do well when mixed together. The appeal of coffee and cookies to me, Starbucks web page ideal, is the contrast between the strong coffee and sweet cookies. How many people would like their coffee to smell and taste like cookies?  There may be some, but I cannot go for it.<br /><br />As for the claim of all-natural ingredients, corn maltodextrin is listed on the package as one of the ingredients.

Brew a cup and the whole house smells great. Vanilla and coffee together is a match made in heaven. Allow a small piece of dark chocolate to melt in your mouth with this coffee, and that is even better. I just didn't care for the Starbucks burnt bean flavor.<br /><br />If you love the Starbucks burnt roast flavor of their coffee, it is possible that you will love this coffee. The vanilla flavor is clearly present at exactly the right level, not so overbearing that the coffee tastes like vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this is not a shot of vanilla sugar syrup for your coffee. Nor is it a Mini-Moo French Vanilla cream addition. The flavor is one of coffee, pure very dark roasted Starbucks coffee, and vanilla, no sweetness or milk flavor.<br /><br />The package directions, 2 tablespoons of coffee per six ounce cup is extremely strong, especially if made in a French press. I love espresso, am addicted to Nespresso (three each morning), really strong coffee in France and Italy, and Turkish coffee without sugar. I drink all coffee black. So I am not afraid of a strong coffee. The problem for me, Starbucks burns their beans, and it imparts a flavor that I just don't enjoy. Clearly a bazillion people disagree with me. However, these directions made coffee that was just way too strong. It might be fine in a drip coffee maker, but certainly not a French Press with water at exactly 180 degrees."

Great I thought, now to add the usual 2 spoons of sugar. Did that, took a sip & found the coffee to be pretty good with some vanilla flavor still there. To sum up it's a nice coffee that I'll enjoy drinking even though I'll admit that I prefer the darker roasts like French Roast, Sumatra & Italian Roast. Not quite a 5 star coffee but still good enough for drinking anytime during the morning, throughout the day or in the evening.

Fenner,0,0,2,1290729600,Slightly better than other flavored coffees,"Because your baseline tastes may well differ from mine, here's where I'm coming from: I'm not a fan of artificially flavored coffees, but I do like an occasional shake of cinnamon or cocoa in my coffee--and a pinch of cardamom is awesome. I do like Starbucks coffee--some people say it tastes burnt, though, or is over-roasted. I take my coffee black or with cream, and only occasionally add some Splenda -- I don't ""do"" sugar. I dislike the ""Bailey's Irish Cream""/butter pecan/you name it -flavored-type coffees--they taste of artificial flavors to me, and the quality of the coffee isn't that good. So I set out to try the new Starbucks ground ""naturally"" flavored coffees...<br /><br />Well, this was rather disappointing. I know that ""natural flavors"" doesn't necessarily mean ""natural vanilla flavor""-- all it means is that the flavorings are derived from plants and not petroleum--could well be from pine trees. This coffee lists in order the following ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root. .... Now, we don't know what the ""natural flavors"" are, but they are something different from ground vanilla beans, and listed before them. The sarsaparilla root is kind of weird too-- sarsaparilla, the beverage, tastes like root beer! Well, this has that ""artificially flavored coffee"" taste--smells and tastes a lot like Bailey's Irish Cream flavored coffee, although the underlying coffee is much better than you might get from a supermarket brand of flavored coffee--it's Starbucks, after all.  I put Splenda in mine, as well as cream--not very pleasant on its own.<br /><br />On the plus side, you can control how sweet you make it, and use the sweetener you prefer--but why not just put a glug of natural vanilla extract or some ground vanilla beans in your regular coffee yourself? That way your coffee maker doesn't get all flavored up, either.<br /><br />and--it's not the 3/4 lb. (12 oz)  bag you might have become accustomed to (remember when all coffee came in a full pound bag?) --it's only 11 oz!! I guess they think we aren't paying attention."

When I opened the pouch, the vanilla smell was definitely there, and I thought this would be smooth, delicious coffee. After brewing a pot, I really couldn't taste the vanilla at all, and the coffee tastes just like the usual Starbucks fare -- strong and a little bitter.

For me, this was a mistake.  WAY too sweet, and I like vanilla flavored creamer in my coffee, but used plain half n' half for this one and it still tasted too sweet to me.<br /><br />The second pot I chose to mix this coffee (50/50) with a Kona blend from the local market.  My husband still thought the blend to be too sweet, but I liked it.  I guess the bonus here would be that if you like a more subtle, less sweet vanilla flavoring to your coffee the package will last you that much longer when you blend it with something non-flavored!<br /><br />I give it a 3-star rating because to me, it's just OK.  I can't say I like it, but I don't dislike it either.<br /><br />The packaging says 'an accent of vanilla' and 'an understated vanilla highlight'.  I'd beg to differ.  I'd say something like infused with a 'strong vanilla overtone'.  The ground coffee contains ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />Maybe it's the root that does it?

I get out a nice, green fruity extra virgin olive oil and spices and some decent white or red wine vinegar, and make something entirely superior to, while still generally cheaper than, those supermarket blends of indifferent grade spices and chemical thickeners, swimming in mostly-canola oil.<br /><br />And why the heck am I talking salad dressing in a coffee review?<br /><br />I make coffee, I tend towards the similarly purist.  Whole bean.  You can get a basic grinder model for the price of a pound or two of the beans, and pre-ground is pre-staled, under the best of circumstances.  As for flavoring?  Flavoring is something I've long believed was invented by coffee brokers to get the lower grade stuff off their shelves.  And those flavors are generally lab-created, both for economy and for more precise/consistent control of the product.<br /><br />So I obviously come to this coffee with my biases, but I also love Starbucks coffees, bought whole from a Starbucks storefront.  I do notice a quality difference right away with the supermarket blends - I think in their own stores, the beans just turn over faster.<br /><br />Yet, as it happens, Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla coffee has (for me) a few advantages - chiefly, natural flavoring.  In this case, vanilla, and sasparilla, long a favorite ingredient of old-fashioned carbonated beverages.<br /><br />Brewed my first cup in my coffee maker.  And I hated it.  Very odd, unpleasant, cloying, bad, chemical taste.  Any vanilla taste or aroma, stayed behind in the bag.  Now, other reviewers clearly, have loved it.  Did I get a bad batch?  (This happens.  What one reviewer says about one bag has to be taken as one data point only.)<br /><br />Unwilling to give up on a perfectly, well, full bag, I decided to try cold brewing.  You can buy a fancy appliance (Amazon here carries no less than 4 systems for the purpose), or you can acquire a largish (6"" or so) fine mesh strainer and a quart jar.  Stir together ½ lb of ground coffee with 4.5 cups cold water, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain the next day, and the resulting concentrate stays fresh tasting for a week or 2.  You'll need to add water in a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio, with the ""1"" being the concentrate.<br /><br />The cold brewing technique has its pros and cons.  Pro:  it's really convenient to make a week's worth of concentrate, as most of the ""work"" is just giving it the time to steep.  For the acid sensitive or just those who just prefer a smoother brew, it is a miracle.  But for the ""Con"": the real nuance and complexity of some of the best coffees comes along with the coffee oils that release under HEAT, and I do notice some flavor loss with some of my favorite coffees, cold brewed.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla was made for cold brewing.  The delicate essence of non-lab created flavors held up much better un-""cooked"".  I tasted vanilla, and yes, even the sasparilla, which people tend to know from Root Beer.  The off notes were still there in the background but more carbonated-soda reminiscent than they were harsh or offensive.  And yes, this is darning with faint praise, but...<br /><br />I'd buy this.  If I had a group to caffeinate for a hot summer event, and minimal time to futz with grinders or syrups or vanilla beans or cooling and icing hot coffee, this would be the trick.<br /><br />For home use...sorry.  Whole beans.  An extra 30 seconds of effort for 10 times more taste, and maybe a dollop of the Torani syrup, if my heart is set on flavoring.<br /><br />So, Starbucks, if you can ""infuse"" a whole bean with all natural flavors, I'd love to hear about it.  Maybe you could just sell the beans with a bottle of ground vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg/whatever powder like you have in your stores - low tech, but lovely.  In the meantime, 3 stars for a catering/get-together blend that is admittedly worlds better than you average foodservice pre-ground.<br /><br />Just brew it cold."

The grounds have a rich, nutty aroma and it brew up nicely. My only issue is that even with its fancy name, it still tastes like an added flavor and not ""infused"" with the beans themselves. To me, it tastes very similar to products from other big American brands -- suitable for most general purposes but for a truly exceptional cup of coffee you'll have to pony up a little more."
133251,B0090X8IPM,A96AUNSF6GESO,Janeite,0,0,4,1290556800,Very Rich and Dark,"Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was ""fine"" but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste. Since the holidays are approaching, I can see our family drinking this with dessert (or even as dessert after some turkey and dressing), and I also am considering picking up a few bags as holiday gifts. If you like Starbucks coffee this may be one you'd like to try."

Even though I love cinnamon and sometimes add some ground cinnamon to my coffee grounds to flavor regular coffee, I didn't much care for the flavor of Starbucks cinnamon flavored coffee.  This vanilla flavor is pretty good, however, though I will say that I don't like it enough to buy it again.  The real winner of the three is the caramel flavor.  While drinking it won't make you think you're eating a caramel candy, it does have a very pleasing flavor whether consumed hot or cold.  That's the only flavor of the three that I have purchased repeatedly and will purchase again.<br /><br />As for the underlying coffee flavor of this particular flavor, I think it suffices to say that it tastes like a medium roasted Starbucks coffee.  I happen to like Starbucks' coffee beans, but I know some people don't care for the brand.  If you're a fan of Starbucks, this roast/flavor is consistent with what you've come to expect from them."

I've tried to add sugar, cream, milk, half and half in different combinations and it just didn't taste good to me so I stopped wasting my money.  But since this was free through Vine, I thought I would try this one to see if it was more of the same and was pleasantly surprised.  Instead of the recommended 2 TBS for every 6 ounces of water, I just use one heaping tablespoon, which may have toned it down a bit.

Here's what I got: The coffee out of the bag smells and looks great. The ground beans have a medium to fine consistency.  Two thumbs up so far.<br /><br />I brewed a few cups with filtered water and the excellent aroma exploded.  The aroma gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.  The coffee in the mug also has a nice color and texture (brewed strong with filtered water it is medium-bodied).<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee is also very good.  The vanilla is sort of ""behind"" the coffee, so it doesn't jump out at you but you know it is there.  I've had other vanilla coffees in which the vanilla overpowers everything; the Starbucks vanilla doesn't do that at all.  I like that.  Along with the vanilla, there may be some hints of butter and cinnamon in the cup.  The expert taster might even notice the trace of sasparilla root hiding in there.  As far as acidity goes, the cup is more soft and sweet than sour and acidic (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was also surprised that this cup does not have the typical burnt (after)tastes that some Starbucks coffee has - there is no murky/dirty lingering flavor.  The cup is pleasant from start to finish.<br /><br />All in all, I was nicely surprised by this cup of coffee and do recommend it."

Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a ""hater"". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a ""subtle flavor"" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says ""Latin American beans"" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and ""natural flavor"" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.

If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and ""other natural flavors"").<br /><br />Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified ""natural flavors"".<br /><br />I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br /><br />Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.

The vanilla component is very strong with the fresh grounds.<br /><br />I made the first cup and drank it black to get the unadulterated flavor. The recommended amount of coffee, 2 tablespoons per 6 oz, is a very, very strong cup of joe. I like strong coffee but 2 T per 6 oz of water is too strong even for me so I brewed it at about 2T for 10oz of water which is still a really strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />My second cup I brewed the same as the first but added Coffee Mate Peppermint Mocha powdered creamer - super tasty. I like that creamer flavor and I wanted to see how the vanilla would stand out. Really it got lost in the stronger flavor of the creamer. There wasn't much vanilla to cover in the first place. I've used the creamer with non-flavored coffee and I cannot tell the difference in taste as far as the vanilla is concerned.<br /><br />So, good coffee with a very mild vanilla taste."

For this reason I try to cycle through flavors, and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle.

I never had their DIY beans and grounds before and I like this much better than what they serve in their chains.  I think it is because I can use a bit less grounds and steep how I like; it creates a cup that is just as strong, but not so bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />I used 2/3 of what the bag recommended and it is still very robust.  I made it in a french press for 4 minutes, added 2 creams and 1 sugar, and it kept its deep java edge despite my add-ins.

I served it to family who visited who are AVID coffee drinkers and they enjoyed it as well - actually asked me what brand it was.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy your flavored coffees, Vanilla is a GREAT flavor to have on hand since you can do so many things to it in my opinion.

I did, hoping to get that amazing taste other reviewers have mentioned.  After making the cup of coffee that I always do, I sat down at my desk, had a sip, and waited for the full experience: the taste on the tongue, the swirl to the rest of my mouth, the final swig down my esophagus, and, finally, the awaited aftertaste.  It was fine until the last step: the aftertaste.  Here is where I recollected the pangs that bitter coffees leave, and it'll be a while till I try home-brew Starbucks again.  My co-worker even admitted it was bitter.<br />Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not completely anti-Starbucks.  While this specific home-brew leaves a wonderful vanilla initial taste, the in-store coffees taste better (but are still bitter to me), and their specialty drinks are amazing.<br /><br />Because I've had horrible experiences with Starbucks home-brew coffee, I wait for my trip to my grandparents' to drink home-made coffee, and will settle with my Nescafe."

I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees because most taste weak or painfully artificial, but this one is really enjoyable.  In fact, I just got some from Gevalia coffees recently, and I liked this one better than theirs.<br />My only reason for withholding a star is that the coffee disappears quickly and has a bit of a bitter aftertaste.

Although that is not a very unique thing in our time, I tend to avoid some flavored coffees because they tend to get old pretty quick.

My wife enjoys the aroma as it brews.  She does not like the smell of some coffees, but this one is pleasant and it really tastes like it smells.

It's almost a little too much in the morning, though I suppose it'd make a good dessert coffee.<br /><br />Then there's the Starbucks factor, of course. If you're socially conscious enough to care that this is labeled as a fair trade item, you probably also care about the fact that Starbucks is a union-busting company.

Opening the package and a very subtle smell of vanilla and coffee is inhaled. I made my coffee in my trusty Cuisinart Coffee maker, and used the usual directions. I poured a cup of the coffee and an aroma of coffee and vanilla lingered. I usually taste new coffee, black, to get the full flavor and this did not disappoint. The taste is a strong medium dark roast. A mellow vanilla flavor blends. The after taste had a darker roast flavor. I then tried it with a little half and half, and this was delicious.

There is another nice flavor in there which I couldn't quite place, but after reading the ingredient list on the bag I assume it is the Sarsaparilla Root. The coffee is slightly bitter, which adds to the complex flavor. (There is a yin-yang thing going on with the sweeter flavors.)

I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee."

I brewed it 3 ways: vacuum, press, drip.<br /><br />This a relatively fine grind. I'd call it the finest limit of drip coffee. Beyond that, we're getting into espresso territory.<br /><br />Against my better judgement, I tried it in my French Press. The fine particles plug up the steel mesh making the plunger difficult to press. The finer particles got into the brew. There was a very thick sludge at the bottom of the cup. Flavor-wise, it was intense but not bad. There was a slight bitter taste and a silky texture which I suspect was from the dust in suspension. So I ran it through a cone filter. The resulting brew was still intense but lost all of the vanilla aroma. The texture was too thin. It basically became a better than average cup of ""diner coffee"". Easy to drink, dark & tasty, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I expected great results from the vacuum brewer. While brewing, it filled the kitchen with vanilla, but when I tasted the coffee, there was only a hint of it. I don't think it brewed long enough to pick up the vanilla, or maybe it was so hot the vanilla vaporized rather than dissolve. In any case, the final product was only slightly better than the pressed-then-filtered coffee above. Not recommended.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best results came from my drip machine. I used the freebie Gevalia gave me with membership (yeah, I'm a sucker for free stuff). I'm drinking the stuff now as I write this review and it's exceptional. I only used 2 Tbsp to 6 servings of water and the taste is just about right. It has a rich mouth-feel, a fair amount of vanilla aroma, a robust coffee taste.<br /><br />I've bought and tasted flavored coffees before and have come to the conclusion that most of the manufacturers are just masking cheap, dry, tasteless coffee with deceptively sweet aromas. Those coffees rarely taste like coffee and never taste like the additional flavor, which is why I call them ""scented coffee"" rather than ""flavored coffee"". So color me jaded. But the stuff from my drip machine actually TASTES LIKE VANILLA! And maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but I'm getting a hint of ice-cream too!

I have always just let my manual espresso machine continue to brew after it's normal double espresso, and the results are very good. I generally use a darker, bolder roast, and since I have tried Starbucks bold roast before, It felt this might make a nice change. This method of brewing really brings out the quality (or lack thereof) in a coffee.<br /><br />The results<br />This coffee makes a lot less ""crema"", which is what espresso machines put out as a sort of light brown colored foam at the top of the coffee. As to taste, it is (as expected) a lot less bold. My initial thought was that I found the vanilla to be a bit sharp or bitter, but then I'm using an espresso machine, not a french press or brew machine. At the same time, I didn't taste the coffee as much as I might prefer.<br /><br />However, after sipping a bit over half the cup, I find that it is actually a pleasant drink; by the time I emptied my cup, I decided that I will make more of this coffee - as a change of pace, not as my primary flavor or brand. I can taste the vanilla, and a bit of the coffee. Perhaps this means that the blend is very good - if they were aiming for exact balance. I would characterize it as a ""vanilla and coffee drink"" rather than a ""vanilla flavored coffee"" because that more accurately describes the overall flavor.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Flavored coffees are a world to themselves - one either likes the concept of putting additional flavor in coffee, or one doesn't - there isn't much in between.

Few coffee companies achieve that ""happy medium"" of providing specialty flavor without compromising the integrity of the coffee itself.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is the exception.  This mostly medium roast has an unmistakable but not obnoxious vanilla perfume upon opening.  I was pleased to find that upon tasting, there is indeed a distinct vanilla note to the coffee, but one that is content to stay in the background and compliment rather than dominate.  It is not overly sweet and wears on the palate well over the course of a few cups.<br /><br />I you are the type who doctors your coffee up with flavored sugars and/or creamers the subtleties of this coffee may not matter to you.  But for those who are interested in actually tasting the coffee, this is a good buy."
133351,B0090X8IPM,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,Brad Willis,1,2,4,1290297600,Here's what many aren't understanding about this coffee,"They aren't understanding that the vanilla flavor is *supposed* to be subtle.  If you don't believe me, just read the bag because it states this quite clearly.  I've seen many reviews where the reviewer is dinging the rating because the flavor is subtle and that's not fair in my opinion because that's what Starbucks is trying to accomplish.  And for those who say that there is no vanilla flavor, I strongly disagree.  It's there but it's subtle, which is the entire idea here folks.<br /><br />Along those same likes, I thought I'd compare the subtle flavors of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee to the more pronounced flavors of the Melitta Pariaian Vanilla coffee.  So I brewed two cups and then sampled each side-by-side.  Following are my impressions of each coffee.<br /><br />Cost: While prices change all of the time, as of this writing, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.59 per ounce.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.58 per ounce.  So in essence, the price is roughly the same between the two.<br /><br />Color/Roast: The color looks about the same between the two.  It's a medium roast or roughly a city roast for those who know what that means.  In the past I've felt as if Starbucks overroasts some of their coffee.  Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case with their Natural Vanilla Coffee.<br /><br />Grind: The grind is also about the same.  Melitta calls it an extra fine grind but both are probably somewhere between a fine grind and an extra fine grind.  I brewed both cups in my Jura S7 espresso machine in the Cafe Americano style, which is basically hot water added to a shot or two of espresso.<br /><br />Aroma in the bag: Starbucks mostly smells like very good quality coffee.  The scent of vanilla is present but subtle.  What vanilla scent is there is reminds one of  fresh and natural ingredients.  The Melitta has more of a pronounced vanilla scent.  The Melitta's scent is pleasant but slightly artificial to my nose.<br /><br />Aroma in the cup: The vanilla scent is very subtle with respect to Starbucks Natural Vanilla.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla has a stronger, but not overpowering scent.  There's more vanilla scent in the Melitta cup to be sure.<br /><br />Flavor: Both coffees are very pleasant, although I'd characterize Starbucks Natural Vanilla as being a very good quality coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla versus Melitta's Parisian Vanilla coffee being a vanilla-flavored coffee, if that makes sense.  While I still like and recommend the Melitta, I think I like it a little bit less now that I've tried the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee.  That's because the Starbucks brew has a fresher and more natural aroma and flavor.  But again, the Starbucks coffee is far more subtle than the Melitta coffee.  For some, that will be a good thing and others will undoubtedly wish for a more forward vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients: The Starbucks Natural Vanilla lists their ingredients as ""Ground Coffee, Natural Flavors, Ground Vanilla Beans & Indian Sarsaparilla Root"" (with Corn Maltodextrin & Vegetable Glycerin added).  Melitta doesn't tell you what's in their blend.  I visited Melitta's website in an effort to determine what sort of ingredients are used to flavor their Parisian Vanilla.  They use words like ""rich"" and ""smooth and creamy"", but nothing more specific that I could find.  So I am going to assume that Starbucks uses ingredients that I would consider to be of a superior quality to the ingredients used to flavor the Melitta Parisian Vanilla.<br /><br />Recommendations: One thing that I like to do is to buy non-flavored beans and simply add a teaspoon or tablespoon of fresh vanilla to a cup of non-flavored beans.  So this is also an option.  If you go this route, use only real vanilla and not the artificial stuff.  Now with respect to these flavored coffees, they're both very good.  Tasting the two coffees side-by-side gave me a good opportunity to compare the two.  While I still like the Melitta Parisian Vanilla, I prefer the subtle character and fresh ingredients of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  If you prefer a coffee with a more pronounced but not overpowering vanilla flavor, go with Melitta.  If you prefer a well-balanced coffee with a subtle but fresh and natural vanilla flavor, you might prefer the Starbucks version.  If you're not sure, consider trying each and decide for yourself, as they're not terribly expensive.  But in the end, I do think that they are both very good."

I generally find them frivolous when I'm feeling generous and a sign of moral weakness when I'm not. In fact, I chose this coffee from Amazon vine by accident, and only finally tried it months later, when I ran out of regular coffee and was desperate. I stored it in the freezer in the meantime, so it would be as fresh as possible and I'd be giving it a fair shake, since ground coffee can lose flavor so quickly.<br /><br />I tried to temper my review to judge this product as someone who doesn't have a moral objection to flavored coffee (no one with my preference would buy it in real life, so it's unfair to judge it by the standards of someone who dislikes flavored coffee), and just rated the overall quality of the coffee and the strength and quality of the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, whether iced or hot.<br /><br />The verdict: I'm still no fan of flavored coffee. But this coffee is good enough, and the vanilla flavor is strong but not cloying. I would definitely tolerate it for the sake of pleasing a guest who liked flavored coffees--which is more than I've ever been able to say for a flavored coffee before (typically, flavoring seems to be a compensation for crappy coffee, not an addition to good coffee). Hot, I found it tolerable (=very good, if I actually wanted vanilla in my coffee). And iced, it was actually verging on pleasant. It has a very faint acrid afternote, almost like chickory coffee, which I think would be dispelled or improved with milk, which most flavored coffee drinkers I know favor anyway.<br /><br />While I still wouldn't drink it on purpose if there was any regular coffee in the house, I didn't find it to be the abomination I expected, and I feel confident that it would be well received by flavored coffee lovers, so I give it 4 stars for quality and strength, and its expected success with people who like this stuff."

In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.<br /><br />I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).<br /><br />After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.<br /><br />When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.

The vanilla is highlighted but not overdone.<br /><br />I usually drink my coffee black and without sweetening and for my taste <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>  can stand alone without additional enhancement.<br /><br />The brewing recommendations suggest 2 Tbsp coffee for every 6 fl oz water.  I find that a bit too much and get a smoother, less biting flavor with 1 1/2 Tbsp coffee per 6 fl oz water, but that of course is to my taste.<br /><br />I do wish the coffee could be fair trade and organically grown but Starbucks states on the package that the coffee is ""100% Responsibly grown.  Ethically traded.""  At least that is something in the right direction.<br /><br />Finally, I noticed a special offer on my package ~ take the empty bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> to a participating Starbucks and receive a free ""tall"" brewed coffee.

I received one bag of this coffee from the Vine program. The day preceding its arrival I had brewed some French Vanilla by a brand that I regularly use and which is rated higher than Starbucks by the best known testing and rating org. This offered me an opportunity to make a somewhat taste comparison although, admittedly, the Starbucks was not French Vanilla.<br /><br />In the taste test Starbucks came in second. It was neither as smooth nor as tasty as the competitor. I drink my coffee with fat-free milk and no sugar so I get a fairly good opportunity to evaluate the taste. Starbucks afficionados undoubtedly will praise this and they have every right to do so and I have no quarrel with that.

The vanilla doesn't seem to stand out or on its own. To me, the only way I can describe it is that the vanilla tastes ""burnt.""<br /><br />As a comparison, I tried adding Torani french vanilla syrup to my regular coffee. I liked that better. I think adding any type of vanilla flavor to regular coffee would produce a similar or better taste than buying it with the flavor already in it.

In general, a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does.

It is unmistakably vanilla flavored coffee. I followed Starbucks instructions on the bag and added 2 tablespoons for each 6 FL of water to my coffee machine. First impression was that the coffee is on the bitter side, but tastes like the good Starbucks coffee that you drink at any of their coffee shops. I added some sugar (I'm not a fan of masking the coffee taste by adding creamer)  and I took few sips. I decided to add a little more sugar (about 1 teaspoon per 6 ounce cup) and that tasted good to me. The vanilla taste is there. The strong slightly oily taste of a strong Starbucks coffee is all there. The next day I decided to make it slightly stronger, so I added 5 tablespoons for 12 ounces of water (instead of 4) and that seems to have all the elements I like about a good cup of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and you like Starbucks coffee and you also enjoy vanilla flavor, this is definitely a coffee worth considering!"
133420,B0090X8IPM,A32O98PFC3OP7K,A Gamer at Heart,0,1,4,1290384000,"Smells Good, Tastes Good . . .","Since I drink my coffee black without any creamer or sweeteners, the taste of the coffee itself really matters to me.  This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.<br /><br />The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.<br /><br />At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees."

We use an expensive drip-brew machine, cold filters, specially filtered cold water, and fresh fine-ground coffee from Pete's.<br /><br />However, we also frequent Starbucks when traveling, and Seattle's Best, and even [shudder] Java City from time to time.  We have exacting standards which we use at home, but we are fine with (and even enjoy), the occasional cup of Starbucks coffee, etc.<br /><br />With that in mind, I when ahead and ordered this coffee sampler bag from Amazon Vine, figuring it might be an interesting trial.  It was interesting all right, but only in the ""i can't believe they tried to sell that as a premium new product"" sort of interesting.<br /><br />The grounds arrive dried out and brittle, I suspect freeze-drying was the culprit.  The bag is a cheap-seal bag, glued shut, and the feel and smell of the grounds screamed ""cheap.""<br /><br />But, even with those misgivings, I soldiered on.  Maybe the coffee those grounds produced wouldn't be THAT bad ... right?  It is Starbucks after all, they have a MINIMUM reputation they are trying to maintain ... yeah, I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee produced from these grounds was bitter, acrid, and acidic.  The vanilla flavoring is obviously an additive that was poured on to the beans, and it also contributes to the bitter and acidic taste -- you can feel it in the back of your throat, and curdling the taste buds at the back of your tongue.<br /><br />Cream and sugar mask some of the unpleasantness, but only some of it.  The bottom line is this product is a cheap, freeze-dried coffee bean that has been sprinkled with the cheapest imitation vanilla ""flavoring"" they could find.  I have tasted real vanilla bean infused flavor, and also premium vanilla extract flavor, and this was not it.<br /><br />If you want vanilla flavored coffee, I would say your best bet is to buy quality beans/grounds, and brew them properly, and then add a shot or two of premium vanilla syrup, or keep a couple of vanilla beans in your coffee beans/grounds, and let the flavor infuse directly into the coffee before brewing.<br /><br />Stay away from this offering from Starbucks, it is just nasty."

Now? Just 11 ounces? Aside from the shrinking amount of coffee for the price (leaves a bad taste in my mouth!), how about the coffee? Well, I really have a liking for anything vanilla from juicing, to smoothies and coffee too. When drip brewed, I find this coffee a bit too full flavored (slightly bitter to me) and add a bit of creamer to soften it a bit. I am not a huge coffee drinker since a recent heart attack and had to go to decaf so this new batch is for my wife. She doesn't care at ALL for this brand however unless she pours in about 3-4 ounces of dairy creamer (coffee-mate French Vanilla from Nestle) so the price is just crazy for me when I see how she ""modifies it""! But this is from a guy who just drinks a cup of instant Folgers decaf every morning these days (sad I know).<br /><br />  So I have to defer to the connoisseurs on snob appeal and such. To me, it has always just been a nice cup of coffee before I was no longer able to drink with any caffeine. This brand was just one in a bunch of experiments I treated myself too after retirement before the heart attack. To ME, it is just an ""average"" coffee with an above average price. To be fair, remember I am not a big coffee person so this is perspective from an old guy who just was a casual drinker of coffee, not a fanatic. I just don't see the value given both my wife and myself added so much coffee creamer to get the desired taste of Vanilla? I still rate this 3 stars (average) since I may just not be the type of coffee drinker to ""appreciate"" something I just don't get. For what it's worth, I also prefer grilled hamburgers over grilled steak. And yes, beer over whiskey too.....No reason to beat up on a Company I really respect for it's success and quality treatment of their employees (but that's another story)!"

I am not normally a fan of vanilla coffee as the smells is often more potent than the taste.  You can always tell when somebody has been in the room with vanilla coffee because the artificial scent lingers.  Whereas other vanilla coffees have the vanilla ending in the scent, this coffee has a nice mild taste that does actually hint of vanilla.  It is not a vanilla taste that overpowers the taste of the coffee like a sugary creamer, it is authentic and subtle.  The coffee even has a smooth mouthfeel that brings hints of creme soda.  Overall, this is a worthy addition to the Starbucks family."

The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added ""vanilla"" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.<br /><br />Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.<br /><br />Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.<br /><br />As a graduate student at U.C.

That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say ""Thanks,"" she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch!

It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!<br /><br />As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup.

Here are her thoughts:<br /><br />As a coffee addict, I anticipated that this blend of ground coffee and vanilla beans would far surpass the cloyingly sweet fake vanilla coffee flavors currently on the market. My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not. I will stick with Starbucks House Blend for regular coffee, and if I'm in the mood for vanilla coffee, I would opt for Dunkin Donuts"

Bux,3,4,4,1290816000,"Truly engaging Vanilla flavor, but still over roasted","I want to preface this by saying I'm not a big fan of most of the Starbucks blends, though I am serious about coffee. I was pleasantly surprised and disappointed at the same time by this coffee.<br /><br />When you first open the bag the smell if of a surprisingly fresh and aromatic vanilla flavor. Upon inspection of the grounds you can see small bits of actual vanilla beans.  The aroma is great and better than traditional flavored coffees that use extracts that coat the beans or are roasted into them.<br /><br />I brewed the coffee using my Capresso 10-cup coffee maker with cold fresh water and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 6 ounce cup of water.<br /><br />The coffee brewed with an aroma of coffee and vanilla. The vanilla dominated the brewing smells. First sip of of dark roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla flavor. I like the mild vanilla flavor. I love coffee and I usually don't like flavors masking the flavor of the beans. Roastmasters work hard to perfect their roasts and often times the flavors added destroy that. This is not the case with this coffee. The vanilla flavor augments the roast and adds to it, not takes away from it. The vanilla flavor is also fresher and more natural without the cloying artificial taste often associated with flavored coffee.<br /><br />My only beef with this coffee and with starbucks in general is that they often over roast their coffees to Italian roasts or beyond the second crack. I find this often masks complexities of the wonderful beans they use and substitute heavy mouthfeel and body for complexity. For that reason, I only give this coffee a four star rating.<br /><br />Another note is that this coffee seems to have plenty of caffeine. With only a cup or two, I feel the effects quite strongly, which is unusual because of the amount of coffee and tea I drink.<br /><br />Overall a good flavored coffee.

The vanilla in Natural Fusions complements the fine coffee taste rather than competing or overwhelming it. It's all about balance. You want to preserve the experience of the main component while taking it to a new level. I think Starbucks got it right here.<br /><br />If you're trying to cut down on sugar (or you know you should but aren't), give Natural Fusions vanilla a try; you may find you don't miss the sugar as much as you think.<br /><br />Instructions: Raise the cup to your lips, inhale, take a sip, inhale again.

There were no grounds in the brewed coffee.  Even I could tell that this coffee had a very nice aroma while it was brewing, once again not overpoweringly vanilla.  Everyone agreed that this is what they would consider a mild roast (milder than the Pike's Peak as a point of reference), some experienced some bitterness while others did not.<br /><br />The overall opinion was that this was an enjoyable coffee which would be ideal for a specially brewed pot, but not for a standard get-you-going-in-the-morning pot.

One really interesting thing I found on the package is that Starbucks will give you a free 12 oz cup of coffee if you take this empty bag to a Starbucks store before the expiration date for the coffee which is printed on the bag.

When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards."

I still prefer my coffee beans (from CoffeeAM or Costco). After several tries I came to like the flavor, but next time I want to break up the routine with some flavored coffee I'll try a different flavor.<br /><br />As for the price, you can definitely find less expensive ground coffee, but in my opinion the price is good. For a cup of coffee with my Capresso machine, I used (roughly) 1.5 tablespoons of the coffee for a cup.

The vanilla flavor is really subtle. I could do with a little more vanilla, and I can see why people are dissatisfied with the slightness of the flavor. What little bit is present, though, is a really nice vanilla taste and not the aftertastey yuck a lot of flavored coffees have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to have my flavored-coffee-hating roommate try this too. (Edited to add: Roomie liked it, commenting that it didn't have that fakey syrup taste; roomie didn't like the strong vanilla aroma as much as I did, though.)

Measurements for my coffee maker were the same as regular coffee, which is a positive since I often have flavored coffees that require extra coffee to get a deep coffee flavor. I did not rate this coffee 5 star because the flavoring was so deep that it actually flavored my thermal carafe, and that flavor stayed for 5 or 6 more pots of ""regular"" coffee, despite being washed out thoroughly after each use.

The bitter and often foul flavor of ordinary coffee was not to my liking and, other than the often-needed boost from the caffeine, I could see no reason to indulge in something with such a nasty flavor.<br /><br />My opinion changed with the invention of flavored and higher quality coffees and as a result of this change, coffee is part of my regular drinking routine. Starbucks is one of the pioneers in leading these changes and when I heard about this, Starbucks Natural Fushions ground coffee with vanilla flavor, I was anxious to sample. Starbucks makes this product using natural vanilla which, combined with quality coffee, sounded like a successful culinary marriage.<br /><br />So, how does this coffee measure up? Well, it certainly has a very pleasant aroma that whets the appetite and I doubt anyone would dislike this aspect of the product. The problem is, unfortunately, the taste itself. I was expecting something much more vanilla- like in flavor but the flavor is instead a little harsh, roasty, and contains only a touch of vanilla. How Starbucks managed to produce such an aromatic product that tastes so different, I am not sure.<br /><br />However, this isn't to say the product is bad. I find it decent as a general coffee for everyday consumption. I also like that Starbucks encourages recycling by offering a free cup of coffee if consumers bring the empty bag to a nearby Starbucks location. The coffee is responsibly grown and ethically traded, too, as indicated by the Starbucks Shared Planet symbol. However, the bottom- line is taste and based on the lack of real vanilla flavor, like I was expecting, I can give this product only an average rating overall."

Does it make up for the lack of that heavenly coffee scent that eluded me? Let's put it this way. If I were given a blind taste test,I'd be hard pressed to identfy this coffee as vanilla flavored. In fact, I'm not sure I could match any specific flavor to this coffee. It's obviously flavored to this taster, but I can only recognize that distant, nebulous vanilla taste because of the flavor's word printed on the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is a pleasant coffee. It's smooth, not bitter, and has a pleasant aftertaste. But if you are looking for a readily identifiable vanilla accent, you will have to be satisfied with vageuely vanilla."

I read that instead of using artificial flavoring they make the blend using actual vanilla beans.  Commercial coffee is usually flavored with artificial flavorings.

However, in my opinion, many flavored coffees tend to be terribly overpowering to the point where I typically brew my flavored coffee with a 50/50 mix of flavored coffee to regular coffee.  Normally I brew my coffee with 1 tablespoon of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and use 1 packet of sugar per cup.<br /><br />I must admit that traditionally I am not a huge fan of Starbucks.  While they put out an excellent quality product, I think their beans tend to be over roasted.  However, I am the first to say it is still a decent cup of coffee.  So when I had the opportunity to try the Starbucks Natural Fusions line, I jumped on the chance.  When I received my bag of Starbucks Vanilla flavored coffee, I pulled out the coffee maker and brewed up a cup.<br /><br />The bouquet of the coffee grounds was a bit unusual.  There was a definite aroma of fine coffee beans, but there was an underlying odor that I can not place.  The ground coffee did not have a distinct vanilla aroma that I could detect.  The same was true with a brewed cup.  While there was a distinctive coffee scent, I still could detect the mystery scent which still did not smell like vanilla to me.<br /><br />The first sip resulted in an overpowering bitter flavor.  Having spent significant time in the Caribbean and South America, I am no stranger to the strong brewed coffees that are prevalent in some countries I have been to.  I am unsure of the source of the bitterness in the coffee (maybe the sarsaparilla root listed in the ingredients), but the bitter flavor was very significant.  The bitter flavor did become less noticeable with the more coffee I drank.  While I became accustomed to the bitterness, it never really went completely away.<br /><br />I really did not detect any vanilla flavor in the coffee, even when used at full strength.  In my opinion, the bitterness really detracts from any flavor of the coffee.  I am sure some people might love this aspect of the coffee, but for me it did not work.<br /><br />Overall, this did not seem to be a bad cup of coffee, but I just could not get past the overwhelming bitter flavor.  I would recommend this blend to people who like an intense, bitter flavor to their coffee.  If you prefer a milder cup of joe, then I would pass on this coffee.

Hard to describe, but it was kind of musty tasting! I tried two more pots just to be sure before I gave up on this.

Since I'm not into Starbucks' fare (I subscribe to the narrative that they've hoodwinked the country into blithely accepting the fallacy that strong, acidic/bitter coffee is Primo, which it isn't), I wasn't surprised by the rather nasty aftertaste that not even 3-4 sugars per cup can mask.<br /><br />I love strong coffee, but good coffee can be strong and not offensively acidic with a bite at the end of the quaff that can peel taste-buds off.  It's all in the beans and the roast.

I also have a commitment to purchasing fair trade, sustainably grown, bird-friendly coffee, and Starbucks does not qualify on any of those counts.

This particular Starbucks flavor comes pre-ground, which immediately starts the decay of the coffee's various oils and flavor notes.

This may not be an issue for most die-hard coffee drinkers, but for me, much of this bag will probably go to waste.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this Starbucks bagged coffee tasted like that flavor of beans at the local Starbucks that no one likes, so it's been sitting there for weeks.

The next pot I made I put in less coffee and it came out better, but still a little on the bitter side. I finally got so that I added 1/3 the amount of this coffee than I would my normal brand and it finally came out decent. Coffee is one of those things that is very individual to each person and their taste. What one person may not like, another might. If you like darker roasted coffee then this would be perfect for you. If you prefer a lighter roast, you may want to pass on this or do what I did and make it much weaker than you would your normal brand.

When this blend is sweetened, however, the vanilla changes to a caramel flavor, which may disappoint those looking to be overcome with the subtle sweetness and aroma of Vanilla.  This blend is best enjoyed either lightly sweetened or unsweetened at all, which may leave many outside the ardent coffee drinker crowd with a bitter tasting disappointment.

The coffee still tasted great but it only had one-half the caffeine.<br /><br />  When I returned to work after the Thanksgiving holidays, I brewed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee using my Keurig Mini Brewer, which makes individual cups of coffee.  I scooped the Starbucks Coffee into the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.  I also used International Delight French Vanilla Creamer.  My vanilla coffee was excellent.

Once I got used to it, I really like the addition of the vanilla to my concoction.  That bag was quickly used up, and I went back to the half-used regular coffee bag.

I have not been a big fan of ""flavored"" coffee since I enjoy the natural taste of coffee with only milk. I tried this out as normal brew coffee and was greatly disappointed. Instead of enhancing the flavor of the coffee, the vanilla just tasted a bit awkward to me. This left me dissatisfied.

Genuine vanilla, just like coffee has a pretty wide range of flavors and quality levels.  This one may be natural but its not quality.  I found the vanilla in this to be aromatic but a bit underwhelming as far as flavoring.  The coffee was good but just a little bitter when consumed black.

Ok, I'm not a coffee master/aficionado/snob, but I know how I like my coffee: strong with cream and sugar.  Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.  As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it ""just right.""  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.<br /><br />First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.<br /><br />In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.  Perhaps some more experimenting is in order, but, for now I will stick with another brand that I already enjoy."
141870,B003GTR8IO,A1QCUMGX7UHFL5,Adam,1,1,4,1292371200,Strong robust coffee without the bitterness,"I have to admit, I was skeptical as I always am when it comes to flavored coffees. Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that ""weird taste"" to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br /><br />I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br /><br />The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there."

I found this coffee to be very coarse tasting and bitter. Even using double the amount of creamer and sweetener I would use did not smooth down the grating roughness of this disaster. I tried to give it a fair shake and  used up half the bag before I couldn't take it anymore. I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor. So there you have it: Alone, it's a disappointing and practically unpalatable disaster; cut it with some average run-of-the-mill coffee and it can become pleasing enough to drink."

I made the first pot when I arrived and was unhappy with how bitter it was, I had been expecting at least a vanilla aroma but there was no vanilla to be discerned in either the scent or taste.  Also when I looked into the bag, it the color of the grounds was far lighter than most of the coffees I make, and the grinds had what appeared to be wood chips in them (now I know that they weren't actually wood chips, but that's what they looked like.)  We drank several more pots of this coffee over the next few days as it was the only coffee that I'd brought, the volume of creamer and sweetner consumed had increased over the next several days.  It was simply too bitter, and did not have an attractive flavor.  I was very disappointed as there are very few Starbucks products that I don't care for - but this falls into that category.  It appears that I will still be brewing Dunkin Donuts coffee at home.  Currently at the price of thirteen dollars for two this is actually a good price should this coffee be to your taste."

While I really enjoy the taste of my regular house/breakfast blend with a splash of vanilla creamer (I don't have to add sugar), it seemed that my normal splash of vanilla creamer did not complement the vanilla already in the coffee.

I do like Starbucks coffee--some people say it tastes burnt, though, or is over-roasted. I take my coffee black or with cream, and only occasionally add some Splenda -- I don't ""do"" sugar. I dislike the ""Bailey's Irish Cream""/butter pecan/you name it -flavored-type coffees--they taste of artificial flavors to me, and the quality of the coffee isn't that good. So I set out to try the new Starbucks ground ""naturally"" flavored coffees...<br /><br />Well, this was rather disappointing. I know that ""natural flavors"" doesn't necessarily mean ""natural vanilla flavor""-- all it means is that the flavorings are derived from plants and not petroleum--could well be from pine trees. This coffee lists in order the following ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root. .... Now, we don't know what the ""natural flavors"" are, but they are something different from ground vanilla beans, and listed before them. The sarsaparilla root is kind of weird too-- sarsaparilla, the beverage, tastes like root beer! Well, this has that ""artificially flavored coffee"" taste--smells and tastes a lot like Bailey's Irish Cream flavored coffee, although the underlying coffee is much better than you might get from a supermarket brand of flavored coffee--it's Starbucks, after all.  I put Splenda in mine, as well as cream--not very pleasant on its own.<br /><br />On the plus side, you can control how sweet you make it, and use the sweetener you prefer--but why not just put a glug of natural vanilla extract or some ground vanilla beans in your regular coffee yourself? That way your coffee maker doesn't get all flavored up, either.<br /><br />and--it's not the 3/4 lb.

Whole bean.  You can get a basic grinder model for the price of a pound or two of the beans, and pre-ground is pre-staled, under the best of circumstances.  As for flavoring?  Flavoring is something I've long believed was invented by coffee brokers to get the lower grade stuff off their shelves.  And those flavors are generally lab-created, both for economy and for more precise/consistent control of the product.<br /><br />So I obviously come to this coffee with my biases, but I also love Starbucks coffees, bought whole from a Starbucks storefront.  I do notice a quality difference right away with the supermarket blends - I think in their own stores, the beans just turn over faster.<br /><br />Yet, as it happens, Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla coffee has (for me) a few advantages - chiefly, natural flavoring.  In this case, vanilla, and sasparilla, long a favorite ingredient of old-fashioned carbonated beverages.<br /><br />Brewed my first cup in my coffee maker.  And I hated it.  Very odd, unpleasant, cloying, bad, chemical taste.  Any vanilla taste or aroma, stayed behind in the bag.  Now, other reviewers clearly, have loved it.  Did I get a bad batch?  (This happens.  What one reviewer says about one bag has to be taken as one data point only.)<br /><br />Unwilling to give up on a perfectly, well, full bag, I decided to try cold brewing.  You can buy a fancy appliance (Amazon here carries no less than 4 systems for the purpose), or you can acquire a largish (6"" or so) fine mesh strainer and a quart jar.  Stir together ½ lb of ground coffee with 4.5 cups cold water, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain the next day, and the resulting concentrate stays fresh tasting for a week or 2.  You'll need to add water in a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio, with the ""1"" being the concentrate.<br /><br />The cold brewing technique has its pros and cons.  Pro:  it's really convenient to make a week's worth of concentrate, as most of the ""work"" is just giving it the time to steep.  For the acid sensitive or just those who just prefer a smoother brew, it is a miracle.  But for the ""Con"": the real nuance and complexity of some of the best coffees comes along with the coffee oils that release under HEAT, and I do notice some flavor loss with some of my favorite coffees, cold brewed.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla was made for cold brewing.  The delicate essence of non-lab created flavors held up much better un-""cooked"".  I tasted vanilla, and yes, even the sasparilla, which people tend to know from Root Beer.  The off notes were still there in the background but more carbonated-soda reminiscent than they were harsh or offensive.  And yes, this is darning with faint praise, but...<br /><br />I'd buy this.  If I had a group to caffeinate for a hot summer event, and minimal time to futz with grinders or syrups or vanilla beans or cooling and icing hot coffee, this would be the trick.<br /><br />For home use...sorry.  Whole beans.  An extra 30 seconds of effort for 10 times more taste, and maybe a dollop of the Torani syrup, if my heart is set on flavoring.<br /><br />So, Starbucks, if you can ""infuse"" a whole bean with all natural flavors, I'd love to hear about it.  Maybe you could just sell the beans with a bottle of ground vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg/whatever powder like you have in your stores - low tech, but lovely.  In the meantime, 3 stars for a catering/get-together blend that is admittedly worlds better than you average foodservice pre-ground.<br /><br />Just brew it cold."

It was sealed, but not vaccum-packed, and the loose grounds only filled about 2/3s of the bag.  This isn't a brick.  It also was extremely easy to open, which was nice for my fingers, but considering what I usually end up wrestling with in other mail-order coffees, I wonder if the other stuff was unnecessarily difficult or if this was just packed the right way.<br /><br />The grounds had very mild vanilla scent, nothing like the beans you grind in the stores or even inexpensive stuff you buy in cans.  It didn't get any stronger when I brewed it.

While the second pot tasted better overall, it wasn't really any more ""vanilla"" than the first and it still had a little bit of a medicinal flavor to it.<br /><br />My recommendation if you really want a good aromatic vanilla flavor would be to stick to another brand coffee; Millstone and Melitta make good versions if you want to go the fancier route and if you're lucky and live in the area or can get it mailed to you, Steep and Brew is the best I've ever had.

This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was ""fine"" but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste. Since the holidays are approaching, I can see our family drinking this with dessert (or even as dessert after some turkey and dressing), and I also am considering picking up a few bags as holiday gifts.

This vanilla flavor is pretty good, however, though I will say that I don't like it enough to buy it again.  The real winner of the three is the caramel flavor.  While drinking it won't make you think you're eating a caramel candy, it does have a very pleasing flavor whether consumed hot or cold.  That's the only flavor of the three that I have purchased repeatedly and will purchase again.<br /><br />As for the underlying coffee flavor of this particular flavor, I think it suffices to say that it tastes like a medium roasted Starbucks coffee.  I happen to like Starbucks' coffee beans, but I know some people don't care for the brand.  If you're a fan of Starbucks, this roast/flavor is consistent with what you've come to expect from them."

Instead of the recommended 2 TBS for every 6 ounces of water, I just use one heaping tablespoon, which may have toned it down a bit.

Along with the vanilla, there may be some hints of butter and cinnamon in the cup.  The expert taster might even notice the trace of sasparilla root hiding in there.  As far as acidity goes, the cup is more soft and sweet than sour and acidic (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was also surprised that this cup does not have the typical burnt (after)tastes that some Starbucks coffee has - there is no murky/dirty lingering flavor.

I must say it has the best brewing aroma of any coffee I have tried so far. The taste was mellow and pleasant. The vanilla is not to strong like some can be. I was very happy that they use fair trade so that the coffee growers get a fair price and the the farming methods are earth friendly.<br /><br />Another perk is when the bag is empty you can take it to a Starbucks and get a free 12 oz brewed coffee. It has to be redeemed within 30 days of the best buy date on the package.<br /><br />It's good coffee. Not a lot of fluff to say about coffee. Give it a try!

This was a real treat - rich tasting, but not bitter. The vanilla is there more as an afterthought, which is a good thing. I like flavored decaf coffee since the flavor tends to ""up"" the taste quota since decaf tends to be lacking in body. But, with regular coffee, I prefer any flavoring to be secondary to the coffee taste. This hits that sweet spot - the vanilla is there, but it doesn't mask or interfere with the coffee taste.<br /><br />I tried this in a drip machine, a Senseo and a french press. The french press results were the best - the flavor really came out, but it was a bit more oily than other brews (I'm assuming this is because I'm so used to decaf). Served it after dinner to some guests and got thumbs up from everyone, even those who stated they don't care for flavored coffee."

Garcia ""Biggie-E""",0,0,3,1290470400,"Not disappointed, not impressed.","As a self-confessed coffee addict for the past 20 years, I'd like to think that I'm a good judge of coffee.  Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a ""hater"". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a ""subtle flavor"" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says ""Latin American beans"" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and ""natural flavor"" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.  If someone served it to me, I'd drink it (black) and not complain... until I got home.  ;-)"

If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and ""other natural flavors"").<br /><br />Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified ""natural flavors"".<br /><br />I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br /><br />Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.

The recommended amount of coffee, 2 tablespoons per 6 oz, is a very, very strong cup of joe. I like strong coffee but 2 T per 6 oz of water is too strong even for me so I brewed it at about 2T for 10oz of water which is still a really strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />My second cup I brewed the same as the first but added Coffee Mate Peppermint Mocha powdered creamer - super tasty. I like that creamer flavor and I wanted to see how the vanilla would stand out. Really it got lost in the stronger flavor of the creamer. There wasn't much vanilla to cover in the first place.

I said ""mostly"" excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees, the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking. For this reason I try to cycle through flavors, and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle.

I never had their DIY beans and grounds before and I like this much better than what they serve in their chains.  I think it is because I can use a bit less grounds and steep how I like; it creates a cup that is just as strong, but not so bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />I used 2/3 of what the bag recommended and it is still very robust.  I made it in a french press for 4 minutes, added 2 creams and 1 sugar, and it kept its deep java edge despite my add-ins.

While this specific home-brew leaves a wonderful vanilla initial taste, the in-store coffees taste better (but are still bitter to me), and their specialty drinks are amazing.<br /><br />Because I've had horrible experiences with Starbucks home-brew coffee, I wait for my trip to my grandparents' to drink home-made coffee, and will settle with my Nescafe."

I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee."

Flavor-wise, it was intense but not bad. There was a slight bitter taste and a silky texture which I suspect was from the dust in suspension. So I ran it through a cone filter. The resulting brew was still intense but lost all of the vanilla aroma. The texture was too thin. It basically became a better than average cup of ""diner coffee"". Easy to drink, dark & tasty, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I expected great results from the vacuum brewer. While brewing, it filled the kitchen with vanilla, but when I tasted the coffee, there was only a hint of it. I don't think it brewed long enough to pick up the vanilla, or maybe it was so hot the vanilla vaporized rather than dissolve. In any case, the final product was only slightly better than the pressed-then-filtered coffee above. Not recommended.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best results came from my drip machine. I used the freebie Gevalia gave me with membership (yeah, I'm a sucker for free stuff). I'm drinking the stuff now as I write this review and it's exceptional. I only used 2 Tbsp to 6 servings of water and the taste is just about right. It has a rich mouth-feel, a fair amount of vanilla aroma, a robust coffee taste.<br /><br />I've bought and tasted flavored coffees before and have come to the conclusion that most of the manufacturers are just masking cheap, dry, tasteless coffee with deceptively sweet aromas. Those coffees rarely taste like coffee and never taste like the additional flavor, which is why I call them ""scented coffee"" rather than ""flavored coffee"". So color me jaded. But the stuff from my drip machine actually TASTES LIKE VANILLA! And maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but I'm getting a hint of ice-cream too! I'm drinking it black, no sugar so it's pretty fascinating.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: When brewed 2:6 in an average #4 drip coffee-maker, you get a delicious coffee treat with the usual Starbucks buzz to brighten up your work-day."

Green,1,2,4,1290384000,Good if you like flavored coffees - Americano review,"I ordered this to try as a different sort of coffee.<br /><br />My brewing method:<br /><br />I normally make Americano, which is an espresso with extra water. I have always just let my manual espresso machine continue to brew after it's normal double espresso, and the results are very good. I generally use a darker, bolder roast, and since I have tried Starbucks bold roast before, It felt this might make a nice change. This method of brewing really brings out the quality (or lack thereof) in a coffee.<br /><br />The results<br />This coffee makes a lot less ""crema"", which is what espresso machines put out as a sort of light brown colored foam at the top of the coffee. As to taste, it is (as expected) a lot less bold. My initial thought was that I found the vanilla to be a bit sharp or bitter, but then I'm using an espresso machine, not a french press or brew machine. At the same time, I didn't taste the coffee as much as I might prefer.<br /><br />However, after sipping a bit over half the cup, I find that it is actually a pleasant drink; by the time I emptied my cup, I decided that I will make more of this coffee - as a change of pace, not as my primary flavor or brand. I can taste the vanilla, and a bit of the coffee. Perhaps this means that the blend is very good - if they were aiming for exact balance. I would characterize it as a ""vanilla and coffee drink"" rather than a ""vanilla flavored coffee"" because that more accurately describes the overall flavor.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Flavored coffees are a world to themselves - one either likes the concept of putting additional flavor in coffee, or one doesn't - there isn't much in between. For anyone who likes flavored coffees, I think this one would be suitable for daily use. Recommended if you like this sort of combination, but not if one prefers more coffee taste and less vanilla addition."

Few coffee companies achieve that ""happy medium"" of providing specialty flavor without compromising the integrity of the coffee itself.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is the exception.  This mostly medium roast has an unmistakable but not obnoxious vanilla perfume upon opening.  I was pleased to find that upon tasting, there is indeed a distinct vanilla note to the coffee, but one that is content to stay in the background and compliment rather than dominate.  It is not overly sweet and wears on the palate well over the course of a few cups.<br /><br />I you are the type who doctors your coffee up with flavored sugars and/or creamers the subtleties of this coffee may not matter to you.  But for those who are interested in actually tasting the coffee, this is a good buy."
142064,B003GTR8IO,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,Brad Willis,1,2,4,1290297600,Here's what many aren't understanding about this coffee,"They aren't understanding that the vanilla flavor is *supposed* to be subtle.  If you don't believe me, just read the bag because it states this quite clearly.  I've seen many reviews where the reviewer is dinging the rating because the flavor is subtle and that's not fair in my opinion because that's what Starbucks is trying to accomplish.  And for those who say that there is no vanilla flavor, I strongly disagree.  It's there but it's subtle, which is the entire idea here folks.<br /><br />Along those same likes, I thought I'd compare the subtle flavors of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee to the more pronounced flavors of the Melitta Pariaian Vanilla coffee.  So I brewed two cups and then sampled each side-by-side.  Following are my impressions of each coffee.<br /><br />Cost: While prices change all of the time, as of this writing, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.59 per ounce.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.58 per ounce.  So in essence, the price is roughly the same between the two.<br /><br />Color/Roast: The color looks about the same between the two.  It's a medium roast or roughly a city roast for those who know what that means.  In the past I've felt as if Starbucks overroasts some of their coffee.  Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case with their Natural Vanilla Coffee.<br /><br />Grind: The grind is also about the same.  Melitta calls it an extra fine grind but both are probably somewhere between a fine grind and an extra fine grind.  I brewed both cups in my Jura S7 espresso machine in the Cafe Americano style, which is basically hot water added to a shot or two of espresso.<br /><br />Aroma in the bag: Starbucks mostly smells like very good quality coffee.  The scent of vanilla is present but subtle.  What vanilla scent is there is reminds one of  fresh and natural ingredients.  The Melitta has more of a pronounced vanilla scent.  The Melitta's scent is pleasant but slightly artificial to my nose.<br /><br />Aroma in the cup: The vanilla scent is very subtle with respect to Starbucks Natural Vanilla.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla has a stronger, but not overpowering scent.  There's more vanilla scent in the Melitta cup to be sure.<br /><br />Flavor: Both coffees are very pleasant, although I'd characterize Starbucks Natural Vanilla as being a very good quality coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla versus Melitta's Parisian Vanilla coffee being a vanilla-flavored coffee, if that makes sense.  While I still like and recommend the Melitta, I think I like it a little bit less now that I've tried the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee.  That's because the Starbucks brew has a fresher and more natural aroma and flavor.  But again, the Starbucks coffee is far more subtle than the Melitta coffee.  For some, that will be a good thing and others will undoubtedly wish for a more forward vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients: The Starbucks Natural Vanilla lists their ingredients as ""Ground Coffee, Natural Flavors, Ground Vanilla Beans & Indian Sarsaparilla Root"" (with Corn Maltodextrin & Vegetable Glycerin added).  Melitta doesn't tell you what's in their blend.  I visited Melitta's website in an effort to determine what sort of ingredients are used to flavor their Parisian Vanilla.  They use words like ""rich"" and ""smooth and creamy"", but nothing more specific that I could find.  So I am going to assume that Starbucks uses ingredients that I would consider to be of a superior quality to the ingredients used to flavor the Melitta Parisian Vanilla.<br /><br />Recommendations: One thing that I like to do is to buy non-flavored beans and simply add a teaspoon or tablespoon of fresh vanilla to a cup of non-flavored beans.  So this is also an option.  If you go this route, use only real vanilla and not the artificial stuff.  Now with respect to these flavored coffees, they're both very good.  Tasting the two coffees side-by-side gave me a good opportunity to compare the two.  While I still like the Melitta Parisian Vanilla, I prefer the subtle character and fresh ingredients of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  If you prefer a coffee with a more pronounced but not overpowering vanilla flavor, go with Melitta.  If you prefer a well-balanced coffee with a subtle but fresh and natural vanilla flavor, you might prefer the Starbucks version.  If you're not sure, consider trying each and decide for yourself, as they're not terribly expensive.  But in the end, I do think that they are both very good."

Except for the boss and controller who loathe fru-fru coffee of any kind, everyone else loved it. The smell from the opened package was very pleasant (always my favorite part of the coffee experience). I felt it was a bit bitter black, but after adding some flavored creamer (yes, I did have some), I ended up with a very yummy cuppa joe.<br /><br />This might not be the roast for everyone (and I see from another review there are some rather, ummm, interesting ingredients there) but this was a definite thumbs up from this office gang."

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""",1,1,4,1291075200,Pleasant Tasting,"Having lived my entire life in the great state of Louisiana, I've always been partial to local coffee brands such as Community Coffee and Mello Joy.  I try to make a point of buying these local brands for the simple fact that the money stays in Louisiana and both of them taste very good.  To me, Starbucks has always been an overpriced and overhyped brand with a brilliant marketing strategy that put them on the map.  Still, I sometimes visit the local Starbucks for a frappucino or even an Earl Grey latte when I have a bit of extra spending money on hand.<br /><br />I picked up Starbucks' Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, via the Vine program.  I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.<br /><br />As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.<br /><br />I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).<br /><br />After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.<br /><br />When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.<br /><br />With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.<br /><br />With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.<br /><br />Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon."

The scent of vanilla is not overpowering and the coffee has an extremely smooth taste to it.

This, of course, can be adjusted for each individual's preference.  The scent is heavenly, as the coffee is brewing and the taste is very robust and holds a light flavor of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.  I had not problems, at all, with this particular coffee.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-bodied coffee with a slight hint of a vanilla taste.

It was neither as smooth nor as tasty as the competitor. I drink my coffee with fat-free milk and no sugar so I get a fairly good opportunity to evaluate the taste.

Additionally, the vanilla flavor in this coffee has what I can only describe as a ""chemical-edge"" and aftertaste to it.<br /><br />I found it undrinkable served full strength, but mixing the grind with a regular coffee before brewing tones down and smooths out the flavor to a pleasant level.

Any review about foods or beverages cannot be totally objective. It is usually subjective to reflect the type of taste enjoyed by the reviewer. We all have different ways to measure what tastes good to us and what doesn't. Some of us may enjoy strong coffee, while others may like it gentler. Some of us hate sour or bitter tasting coffee and others mask the taste totally by pouring so much creamer and sugar until it taste like something else.<br /><br />The Coffee:<br />This coffee has a nice aroma when open the bag. It is unmistakably vanilla flavored coffee. I followed Starbucks instructions on the bag and added 2 tablespoons for each 6 FL of water to my coffee machine. First impression was that the coffee is on the bitter side, but tastes like the good Starbucks coffee that you drink at any of their coffee shops. I added some sugar (I'm not a fan of masking the coffee taste by adding creamer)  and I took few sips. I decided to add a little more sugar (about 1 teaspoon per 6 ounce cup) and that tasted good to me. The vanilla taste is there. The strong slightly oily taste of a strong Starbucks coffee is all there. The next day I decided to make it slightly stronger, so I added 5 tablespoons for 12 ounces of water (instead of 4) and that seems to have all the elements I like about a good cup of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and you like Starbucks coffee and you also enjoy vanilla flavor, this is definitely a coffee worth considering!"

This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.<br /><br />The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.<br /><br />At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees."

We use an expensive drip-brew machine, cold filters, specially filtered cold water, and fresh fine-ground coffee from Pete's.<br /><br />However, we also frequent Starbucks when traveling, and Seattle's Best, and even [shudder] Java City from time to time.  We have exacting standards which we use at home, but we are fine with (and even enjoy), the occasional cup of Starbucks coffee, etc.<br /><br />With that in mind, I when ahead and ordered this coffee sampler bag from Amazon Vine, figuring it might be an interesting trial.  It was interesting all right, but only in the ""i can't believe they tried to sell that as a premium new product"" sort of interesting.<br /><br />The grounds arrive dried out and brittle, I suspect freeze-drying was the culprit.  The bag is a cheap-seal bag, glued shut, and the feel and smell of the grounds screamed ""cheap.""<br /><br />But, even with those misgivings, I soldiered on.  Maybe the coffee those grounds produced wouldn't be THAT bad ... right?  It is Starbucks after all, they have a MINIMUM reputation they are trying to maintain ... yeah, I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee produced from these grounds was bitter, acrid, and acidic.  The vanilla flavoring is obviously an additive that was poured on to the beans, and it also contributes to the bitter and acidic taste -- you can feel it in the back of your throat, and curdling the taste buds at the back of your tongue.<br /><br />Cream and sugar mask some of the unpleasantness, but only some of it.  The bottom line is this product is a cheap, freeze-dried coffee bean that has been sprinkled with the cheapest imitation vanilla ""flavoring"" they could find.  I have tasted real vanilla bean infused flavor, and also premium vanilla extract flavor, and this was not it.<br /><br />If you want vanilla flavored coffee, I would say your best bet is to buy quality beans/grounds, and brew them properly, and then add a shot or two of premium vanilla syrup, or keep a couple of vanilla beans in your coffee beans/grounds, and let the flavor infuse directly into the coffee before brewing.<br /><br />Stay away from this offering from Starbucks, it is just nasty."

Now? Just 11 ounces? Aside from the shrinking amount of coffee for the price (leaves a bad taste in my mouth!), how about the coffee? Well, I really have a liking for anything vanilla from juicing, to smoothies and coffee too. When drip brewed, I find this coffee a bit too full flavored (slightly bitter to me) and add a bit of creamer to soften it a bit. I am not a huge coffee drinker since a recent heart attack and had to go to decaf so this new batch is for my wife. She doesn't care at ALL for this brand however unless she pours in about 3-4 ounces of dairy creamer (coffee-mate French Vanilla from Nestle) so the price is just crazy for me when I see how she ""modifies it""! But this is from a guy who just drinks a cup of instant Folgers decaf every morning these days (sad I know).<br /><br />  So I have to defer to the connoisseurs on snob appeal and such. To me, it has always just been a nice cup of coffee before I was no longer able to drink with any caffeine. This brand was just one in a bunch of experiments I treated myself too after retirement before the heart attack. To ME, it is just an ""average"" coffee with an above average price. To be fair, remember I am not a big coffee person so this is perspective from an old guy who just was a casual drinker of coffee, not a fanatic. I just don't see the value given both my wife and myself added so much coffee creamer to get the desired taste of Vanilla? I still rate this 3 stars (average) since I may just not be the type of coffee drinker to ""appreciate"" something I just don't get.

The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added ""vanilla"" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.<br /><br />Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.<br /><br />Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.<br /><br />As a graduate student at U.C.

My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not.

I was pleasantly surprised and disappointed at the same time by this coffee.<br /><br />When you first open the bag the smell if of a surprisingly fresh and aromatic vanilla flavor. Upon inspection of the grounds you can see small bits of actual vanilla beans.  The aroma is great and better than traditional flavored coffees that use extracts that coat the beans or are roasted into them.<br /><br />I brewed the coffee using my Capresso 10-cup coffee maker with cold fresh water and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 6 ounce cup of water.<br /><br />The coffee brewed with an aroma of coffee and vanilla. The vanilla dominated the brewing smells. First sip of of dark roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla flavor. I like the mild vanilla flavor. I love coffee and I usually don't like flavors masking the flavor of the beans. Roastmasters work hard to perfect their roasts and often times the flavors added destroy that. This is not the case with this coffee. The vanilla flavor augments the roast and adds to it, not takes away from it. The vanilla flavor is also fresher and more natural without the cloying artificial taste often associated with flavored coffee.<br /><br />My only beef with this coffee and with starbucks in general is that they often over roast their coffees to Italian roasts or beyond the second crack. I find this often masks complexities of the wonderful beans they use and substitute heavy mouthfeel and body for complexity. For that reason, I only give this coffee a four star rating.<br /><br />Another note is that this coffee seems to have plenty of caffeine. With only a cup or two, I feel the effects quite strongly, which is unusual because of the amount of coffee and tea I drink.<br /><br />Overall a good flavored coffee.

Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards."

Not at all what I expect from Starbucks!"
142151,B003GTR8IO,A3GFK7F5IUF60X,"Myra Schjelderup ""Ignolopi""",2,3,4,1293062400,Sweet When Strong,"I drink 6-10 ounces of coffee every morning from my excellent Jura-Capresso Machine. Usually I buy beans and they are ground in the machine. I've tried using already-ground coffee before and it didn't come out very strong, but with this coffee that was no problem!<br /><br />The flavor is nice. I drink it with French Vanilla creamer, and the overall effect is a rich vanilla coffee that tastes delicious. I've long been a fan of Starbucks iced and specialty coffees, never so much of just coffee, but it seems the trick is to have it at home-sweet-home.<br /><br />I brewed a pot once (using a different machine), and it came out not bad, but not great. The trick is to make it stronger to get the good flavor across (if you make it too strong, add some other coffee and that produces an excellent effect as well).<br /><br />Admittedly, the first couple times I tried this coffee I thought it was just OK, I can understand why some people don't like it. I still prefer my coffee beans (from CoffeeAM or Costco). After several tries I came to like the flavor, but next time I want to break up the routine with some flavored coffee I'll try a different flavor.<br /><br />As for the price, you can definitely find less expensive ground coffee, but in my opinion the price is good. For a cup of coffee with my Capresso machine, I used (roughly) 1.5 tablespoons of the coffee for a cup. With 22oz total package here (44 tbs) that means it should last roughly a month. $13 for a month of nice coffee - I can do that for quality flavored Starbucks grounds.<br /><br />It will depend on your taste, and I recommend you give this a go."

Coffee does that to me. I'm a coffee snob. There I said it. It's not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery. I love a good strong cup of coffee. To me coffee is a experience for all your senses. This failed.<br /><br />The first moment the bag was in my hands I smelled it, a slight hint of vanilla through the packaging. The best coffee I have had always manages to smell like the addictive bean no matter how it's packaged. That is nothing to hold against Starbucks vanilla though. Great and even good coffee sometimes only release their fragrance after opening. When opened, the package gave a distinct smell of vanilla. So strongly in fact that my head popped back, it smelled like cheap vanilla perfume that I got as a child at the five and dime.<br /><br />I got down to business, packing my coffee maker, frothing the milk and setting out the mugs. Once the coffee was done the smell mellowed a little but still was not appealing. My first sip was confusion. It tasted like coffee made with old milk. I looked at the container of milk which was fresh. I dumped out all the coffee and cleaned the pot again. Second pot same thing.<br /><br />So I left it all for another day. I bought new milk, made my first cup from my favorite brand and it tasted wonderfully. The second pot I made from the starbucks bag. The same results the coffee tasted like it was made with old milk. It was tangy, off and repelling. I asked my friend to try it. No prompting from me and he asked ""Something wrong with the milk? You want me to go downstair and get some?""<br /><br />3 tries from me and one with a friend, each cup was horrid. My regular coffee tasted great. The $1.99 a pound brand that my friend bought to ""test"" the pot and milk was a good solid cup of coffee.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and buy something else. This is horrible."

When I got the box with this coffee inside, the vanilla aroma was coming through the box!  Even the UPS man said ""something smells good in there.""  Opened the box and saw the bag and, it had that good coffee smell with vanilla added.  So good I had to read the directions and make some of this Vanilla starbucks!  The coffee came already ground, not full beans.<br /><br />Oh, I was counting on this being so tasty!  Making it, the aroma it gave off was good.  Drinking it, YUCK, yuck, yuck!  It had one of the worse tastes I've ever tasted.  Like a rubbery, strong, sour vanilla taste. Yes, I know Starbucks coffee is strong, but this is a nasty strong vanilla taste.  Well I dumped it all out, washed everything and the next morning made it again.  Also I had to get rid of that taste in my mouth through a regular cup of coffee!<br /><br />So the next morning I made another batch of this Starbucks Vanilla.  Took extra close attention to the directions to make sure I was doing everything right (which I was).  Tried one cup black, another with cream and sugar.  The same all times!  A terrible taste!  I don't know it's a bad batch of beans, or too much Vanilla was added or bad vanilla was added or what, but it's bad.  Even other family members agree on the taste.<br /><br />A note here.  I went to a Starbucks coffee house and asked the girl at the counter working.  Before I got far she said ""that has to be from a grocery store, Starbucks took it off the menu a while ago.""  I looked and sure enough it's not on the menu!  I asked why and she shrugged her shoulders.<br /><br />Well I was disappointed on this. Actually I'm surprised as I do not think this Vanilla Coffee represents the Starbucks name well.  I've had many different types of their coffee before and never have I tasted something this bad."

It smells great in the bag and smells great brewed. It makes my house smell terrific.<br /><br />Drinking it, I found that it's smooth and drinks really easily. There's a little bit of bitterness (which I don't mind but some people might) and doesn't taste acidic at all to me, though I am not an expert coffee taster and might be getting my terms wrong. The vanilla flavor is really subtle. I could do with a little more vanilla, and I can see why people are dissatisfied with the slightness of the flavor. What little bit is present, though, is a really nice vanilla taste and not the aftertastey yuck a lot of flavored coffees have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to have my flavored-coffee-hating roommate try this too. (Edited to add: Roomie liked it, commenting that it didn't have that fakey syrup taste; roomie didn't like the strong vanilla aroma as much as I did, though.) This could be a good coffee to try if you like vanilla flavor in theory but find most vanilla-flavored coffees too strong or too fake-y.<br /><br />Overall I'm quite pleased with this coffee."

The vanilla is weak, but strong enough to ruin the cup.<br /><br />I got this from the Vines program, and I'd never buy it again. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn't worth the brewing, even if it was free.

Compared to the smell, the vanilla infusion did not have as overwhelming a flavor, but my palate would still have prefered more subtlety in flavoring .

I should have stuck with the French Roast.  I was sadly dissapointed in Fogchaser. It was actually bland, nothing bold about it.  Either there was something wrong with the coffee or it is just plain weak.  I will reorder the French Roast and give the other 46 cups of Fogchaser to my 87 year old Father-in-law who likes his coffee mild."

Needless to say, I serve a LOT of coffee!  Unique in appearance, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups deliver a great cup of coffee!  As other reviews state, you'll notice a heavenly, strong coffee aroma when opening the air-tight plastic packaging.  Once opened, I store my Fog Chaser K-Cups in an empty, (clean) large metal coffee can.  It not only keeps the aroma intact, it keeps the K-Cups nice and fresh for brewing.<br /><br />If you haven't already tried these K-Cups, do!

I have ordered several of their flavors on Subscribe and Save. Can't beat the price and they are all very good tasting coffee.<br />The pods are different but it is not an issue for me. I don't store them in my carrousel as I am afraid they would get ""stale"" but instead store them in a ziplock bag in the cabinet. This works great.<br />I like them all and wish San Fransisco Bay would come out with more flavors."
180803,B007Y59HVM,A2I3KPQFFD7GR8,P. B. Jones,1,1,5,1338854400,size and shape worried me- but taste is where they excel,"The size and shape worried me.  I am glad that I read other reviews first.  The top of these cups are not as big around (diameter) as a regular k-cup.  In fact I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.  But they do.  Then they lack all the plastic that surrounds a normal k-cup on the bottom.  So they definitely look different and weird.  But taste is what is important.  Well taste and price.<br /><br />Taste- I have only tasted Fog Chaser.  It definitely has an upfront bitterness (or acidity) to it.  It is the first thing I notice.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually enjoy some acidity to my cup of coffee.  Otherwise I find it to be a bit bland.  After the acidity comes a great taste.  Very rich and strong.  In fact I think this is the strongest, boldest k-cup I have had.  Only real concern here is the packaging allows the coffee to go stale faster than if each was sealed individually.  It is nice that they come in three separate sealed bags.  But I think we will go through them fast enough that it would not be a problem.  If you drink very slowly and allow these to linger for several weeks I think the taste will definitely be an issue.<br /><br />Price- At 49 cents per cup this is unbeatable.  Then you have the option of buying on subscription and get them at 41 cents per.<br /><br />Conclusion= I love rich/strong coffee and I love the price.  sold."

180805,B007Y59HVM,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,Brian D,1,1,5,1338076800,"A hearty, fresh, and somewhat bold taste","I really like this coffee.  Rich, flavorful, bold, and very tasty.<br /><br />I was put off by the odd look of the cup at first...as many others have described, it looks strange when you first see it.  If you turn it upside down it looks like a cranium in a hair net.  But it's just as easy to use as a typical k-cup, so no problem there.  The only problem you might have is trying to place it in one of those vertical k-cup dispensers you can get wherever you buy k-cups.  This cup doesn't sit well in there.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice when you open the cardboard box and cut open the rather thick plastic pouch the 12 containers come in: the smell.  It's extremely rich, a very deep, bold smell that makes you think of your very best cup of coffee ever.  Think about it, though: that's the smell of your coffee when it's manufactured and placed within the container.  I doubt the plastic k-cups are as bold when they're tapped into by the Keurig machine...I'm sure they've disseminated some of the freshness on their way to you.<br /><br />What I do to keep that flavor is to take each cup out of the nice thick bag and immediately re-seal the bag with a strong clip.  I feel that retains the flavor.  In that sense, I'm glad they don't fit on the vertical k-cup dispensers...I like that the freshness stays intact within the thick plastic bag.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this flavor.  Keep it secure in the plastic pouch and you'll have a great fresh taste every time you want a cup."

Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig."

The good news is, they're delicious.  Both the hubby and I are enjoying them.  I wish I could put them in my K-Cup carousel, but I guess I can live without that little perk in exchange for a more affordable K-cup that still tastes great.  I don't understand why people complaining about them going stale don't put them in a ziploc bag after opening.  We consume at least four cups of coffee per day in our house, so we go through one bag of 12 in 3 days or less.  That's not enough time for the coffee to go stale inside a zip loc bag!

You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, ""the VUE""  that uses different and patented cups."

I have tried just about every K-cup brand.  This is not packaged in the typical K-cup plastic cups.  It comes in bulk (12 per bag) and the One Cups have the same top as the K-cup but insead of the plastic housing it is a filter material.  This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast.

I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste."

The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the ""Keurig"" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out. Really, who wants 80 cups of something you might not like? But now I know it's a winner, I'll be getting them here regularly where they are even more affordable."

The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.<br /><br />The journey brought me to San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser.  Having had the opportunity to travel I had experienced the the brand and was excited to see it ""available soon"" in K-Cups so I didn't hesitate to preorder.<br /><br />As I have come to rely on, Amazon delivered on time and I was anxious to try it the next morning.<br /><br />The Coffee (5 Stars)<br /><br />- Fog Chaser didn't fail to impress. In fact I would say it over delivered on quality based on my expectations - The rich full bodied taste and smooth finish made an excellent addition to my morning routine and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Packaging (2 Stars)<br /><br />-  The K-Cupish like packaging, though innovative leaves room for improvement.  Instead of the traditional solid sealed K-Cup we have all grown use to the San Francisco Bay Coffee comes in a hybrid type packaging.  The coffee is held in a coffee filter material pouch that is attached to a K-Cup like top. It doesn't effect how you us it but it does effect a few other things.<br /><br />First off I seem to get more coffee grounds in my cup than I do with a traditional K-Cup.<br /><br />In addition the individual cups, because the coffee is exposed to air via the filter pouch freshness becomes an issue.  They come in the box sealed in an air tight bag but it is not resealable so once you open it the remaining coffee is exposed.  If this was the only coffee I drank it would probably not be an issue but because I jump around a lot it sits longer effecting the taste.  I guess I could place them in a resealable bag but call me lazy or cheap but I don't and feel I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />Lastly, though very nit-picky the individual cups will not sit in the coffee carousel I have on the counter next to the maker (you probably wouldn't want them to because of the freshness issue) but again it just makes it a little more inconvenient.<br /><br />As I drag myself into the kitchen after loosing the battle with my alarm clocks snooze button and I struggle in to make the first cup to get the caffeine flowing through my system I just don't like to work that hard at it.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />- The packaging itself will probably not keep me from reordering but it will be much less often than I would normally with some of my other favorites.<br /><br />So with all that said, if the packaging doesn't bother you or effect long term freshness, you are in for a very nice cup of coffee."

The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.

Having said that, in my experience it is a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer.  I received an order of three 36 count boxes.  The 36 count boxes were unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  See the customer image I uploaded.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods.  I also have uploaded an image of a pod next to a K-cup for comparison.  The bags are not resealable!  You will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness.  I have found the pods work just as well as a normal K-cup.  I have no complaints about their function.<br /><br />About the coffee:  It is a very strong bold blend.  I think it tastes great, but it is too strong for my wife's taste!  If you like making a bigger cup (running water through the pod twice) it does a great job.  I definitely recommend this if you like strong coffee!"

IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.<br /><br />I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie.

It was delivered as promised, arrived a little crushed, but with no damage to product. I prefer a strong brew of coffee, so it tasted a bit weak for my preference. I really didn't think there was anything special about the small bit of flavor it did have. I will try it again with a smaller brew setting... Keep in mind I love espresso so I'm a hard core coffee drinker.<br />I loved the non-plastic design, and it actually fit in my Cuisinart k-cup brewer even better than the regular k-cup!

I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good."

I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel."

This is then placed in a attractive retail type box<br />that would look right at home on the shelf next to kcups at your favorite retail store.<br />The front of the Box has a drawing of a kcup machine and a blow up of the 1 cup inserted in it.<br />It also lists a few of the compatible keurig type brewers it will work in.<br />The top and back of the box has some photos of environmental projects that the Rogers Family has been involved in.<br />one side has a photo of the rodgers family and their mission statement. The other side has a description of the coffee contained in the box.<br />I can see how these should sell well in the retail setting and also appeal to environment conscious individual and those who are just curious about a new alternative to the standard kcup.<br />I have a Box of Fog Chaser described on the box as a blend with the body of our regular roast and the smokiness of our French roast. A heavy full bodied with hints of cedar,vanilla and toasted almonds<br />balanced with a delicate finish with honey and milk chocolate flavors. Sure sounds appealing to me.<br />When I cut the seal on bag I'm hit with a very strong dark roast scent right away and something poignant but can't place the smell. Maybe it's the ceder they describe on the box and I'm intrigued to brew and try it.<br />Fits in my B70 perfectly and I use the 7.25 oz drop as I normally do. Smells good during brewing just like the extra bold dark roast Kcups I normally drink.<br />Brewed perfectly with no issues. Smells and tastes great in the Cup. Strong full bodied french roast with a smooth finish and I like it as does the wife.<br />I'm not one to name flavors and stuff like that so you will have to try it yourself for a more specific taste profile. Suffice it to say I give Fog Chaser a Big thumbs."

And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups.

These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the ""k-cups"" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward ""would buy again""."

Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups.

After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others."

I tried all the usual suspects.. green mountain, starbucks, caribou, donut, etc.  While I normally love their whole bean, ground, and coffee shop stuff.. I just could never find a full taste in any of them.  So, I gave up on k-cups and went back to my trusty home drip brewer.<br /><br />Then one day our company bought kuerig machines for the office.  So, I decided that I'd go out and try to find a decently priced k-cup, as anything tastes better than the sludge that they make in their industrial drip machines.  These are what I found, and whether it's the coffee, the lack of plastic on the bottom, or some combination, I'd have to say these K-Cups are the absolute closest thing I've found to a regular cup of coffee.  It bold, but not hit you over the head bold.  It isn't watered down.  It's perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, give them a try if you want a great cup of coffee for a great price.

Some of the lesser-priced coffees claiming to work in a Keurig have not been so good. This coffee is excellent - and less expensive to boot! I'm picky about my coffee. I like a dark, bold roast, but find many to be bitter. This roast is smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />While I've not been really good about going out of my way to use ""greener"" products, I'm happy to buy a product that I really like and also happens to be more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />A couple of potential downsides with this new style of k-cup:<br /><br />1) since the filter part containing the coffee is more exposed than a traditional kcup that is encased completely in plastic, I suspect these SFB kcups may not stay fresh for very long. HOWEVER, in the 36-cup pack that I purchsed through Amazon, the company has seen fit to package the cups in 3 heavy, sealed plastic bags, so you only have to open, and expose to the air, 12 kcups at a time. Sidenote: the bag emits a WONDERFUL aroma when you open it!<br /><br />2) Also due to less plastic packaging over the filter, I notice more coffee ""sludge"" at the bottom of my cup than I see with traditional style kcups. This doesn't bother me. I just don't drink that last little bit in my cup. The coffee I DO drink is so rich and flavorful that this just isn't an issue for me.<br /><br />3) I take my new SFB kcups to work and use in the heavy-duty machine used there. Due to the smaller length of these kcups, some Keurig brewers don't recognize the cup as actually being there when you insert it in the basket. However, you can easily override this. When the machine says ""no kcup detected,"" it will usu. also say, ""continue? yes or no"" and you simply press yes. The machine will still function, as it would if you were using it simply to brew a cup of hot water.<br /><br />I will definitely order more of these kcups and am interested in trying other blends in addition to the Fog Chaser. Taste-wise, cost and ease of ordering: an all around ""win"" for me!"

I have always loved my the flavorful and bold 'one cup at a time' coffee faithfully brewed by my cherished <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009314RQ"">Gaggia 90501 Titanium SS Super Automatic Espresso and Cappuccino Machine, Stainless Steel</a>. After six years of faithful service my Gaggia developed an issue requiring it to be sent off for repair, so I purchased a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MZYZHU"">Breville BKC700XL Gourmet Single-Serve Coffeemaker with Iced-Beverage Function</a>. The Breville is intended to be an interim coffee maker while my beloved Italian Gaggia is sent off for repairs (a 3 month endeavor).<br /><br />I don't think of myself as a coffee snob, but I will admit to being particular about the coffee I drink. I was now faced with the challenge of finding some of my favorite coffees in the new to me K-Cup containers. As I came to the realization that my old favorite beans were not readily available in this medium I turned to Amazon buyer ratings as my guide in this java quest. I placed orders for both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00461AF2W"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold 48 K-Cups</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TGDXMU"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Breakfast Blend, 80-Count</a> as a starting point. The SFB Breakfast Blend arrived first. I read all about the Rogers SF Bay family coffee business philosophy and their social give back and thought it was pretty cool. I then looked at their K-cups (OneCups) and thought to myself, ""is that how these things are supposed to look?"" Their OneCups take a more Eco-friendly construction approach so that you see a rounded filter bottom rather than the standard shaped plastic cup bottom. It all seemed interesting, but how would it taste? I thought the Breakfast Blend was really a lovely cup of coffee. The smooth medium-dark roast Central and South American beans are very tasty indeed! I would venture to say that it is on par with any of the very best medium-dark roast coffees available. I would never turn my nose up at it, that is certain. However my personal pallet preference is for something a bit more dark and bold. Three days later I received the Emeril's Big Easy Bold order and immediately tried it. It certainly delivered on all aspects of a robust dark roast with full flavor. It is a bold, dark, classic Parisian roast, in your face brew, just the way I like it. However I find it to have an ever so slight unpleasant aftertaste and a not too far away from, but not quite there bitter finish. Again this is just according to my palette, you may not think so. All in all it is a very good coffee.<br /><br />The SFB Fog Chaser arrived and I couldn't wait to try it out. I cut the seal on bag and was hit with the scent of a strong dark roast. I placed the now familiar OneCup container in the machine and hit brew. Immediately the aromas hit my nose and let me know that I was in for a treat. Fog Chaser is a strong full bodied French Roast with an extremely smooth finish. It is certainly bolder than Breakfast Blend, but is not as bold as Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The taste is full, smooth and well rounded without any unpleasant bitterness or aftertaste at all. I wouldn't have minded if the yield had been slightly stronger though.

It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious.

My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell.

This coffee is strong, but not too strong, and good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.

I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups.

First of all, the Fog Chaser Coffee will do it's job to chase the Fog away: It is REALLY BOLD! I brewed a medium cup because I like bold coffee and was not sure if this brand would deliver. Next time I will not be afraid to brew a large cup. The coffee is rich, flavorful, and did I say Bold?<br /><br />Secondly, I love my Keurig, but hated feeling guilty about all the plastic I was adding to the landfills using the Keurig K-Cups. This pod uses at least 1/3 of the plastic of the standard K-Cup: There is a plastic ring holding the mesh coffee filter pod to the foil cap. Environmentally, this is a step in the right direction. I also feel the design of the pod is what allows the coffee to brew stronger, smoother and with more flavor!<br /><br />My husband does not like his coffee as bold as I do, so I look forward to trying out the other flavors of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup."

This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.

No coffee, no matter if it's whole bean, refrigerated, or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it's roasted.  Coffee should be drunk in about 2-3 days after it's roasted and for about another 2-4 weeks.  The majority of flavor in coffee comes from it's aromatics, and they are gone in a relatively short period of time.

Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine."

This is absolutely the best deal I've found anywhere online for any K-Cups, and this brand has proven to be of excellent quality as well (I've also ordered French Roast Decaf and was happy with those too!).<br /><br />Because these have a filter-type bottom, you will have to keep them in a sealed bag or container once the individual bag has been opened to keep them at optimal freshness, but this is easy to do and, in my opinion, not a big deal.<br /><br />Great price + great taste = great value.

They just like a different taste to their coffee.  So instead, if you like Folgers, Maxwell House, Green Mountain, The Coffee People, etc., you will probably not like this coffee.  The people who will like this, should know who they are, by my previous comment.  I did find a couple of varieties of coffee from the same manufacture I did somewhat enjoy; Coffee People - Black Tiger, Green Mountain - Black Magic and Sumatran Reserve, although I did not like it enough, to purchase them again.<br /><br />Here is a list of coffee I really enjoy and come in K-Cups.<br />Caribou Mahogany, Starbucks Sumatra and Pikes Place."

I personally like the more traditional taste of brewed coffee that this product produces.  The plastic k-cups always seemed to have an awkward taste to them, almost as if I wasn't really drinking coffee.  I do get a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the cup, but also don't mind that.  Since it does turn the inside of my white cup pretty black, I suppose I should also start thinking about what it's doing to my teeth and my insides, but the flavor seems to make it all worthwhile anyhow.

If anything, these are probably a bit more environmentally-friendly than standard K-Cups simply by virtue of containing far less plastic.<br /><br />The only problem is, they just don't taste that good.  The coffee itself leaves something to be desired, surprising considering the history of the company that makes these. (full disclosure: I worked briefly for these folks back in the late '70s. Since I have a personal connection to the products, I really wanted to like them) I liked this better than the Rainforest Blend (which I found weak and watery) but not as much as the French Roast. (which I didn't really care for that much when I first tasted it, but found it grew on me as I worked my way through the case and compared it with other K-Cups)<br /><br />Keep in mind that this review is based on a single cup, and I didn't really like the French Roast when I first tasted it either, so you might want to take this with a grain of salt until I've had a few more opportunities to sample the product and compare it to other varieties.  I'll update if my opinion changes with time, but on first try, I doubt I'd buy this again.  It's better than the Rainforest Blend, but I'd be more likely to buy the French Roast than this.<br /><br />Like other One Cup varieties, these leave a bit more sediment in the bottom of the cup and produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam floating on top of a good cup of coffee - than most traditional K-Cups.  The Fog Chaser seems to produce less than either the French Roast or the Rainforest Blend, for what it's worth. I found the flavor just a little on the thin and bitter side."

I always felt kind of guilty putting so many plastic cups in the garbage. Now to the coffee it is absolutely the best I have had.  A 10oz cup is possible without tasting too watery, especially with the French roast.  Every one of the Rogers family cups are great.  The fog chaser is a little smoother than the french roast but nice and dark.  The french roast is great also not quite as bitter as the usual french roast even the decaf is great.  This coffee rivals fresh brewed easily and is less expensive which is a bonus for those of us who want the freedom of K cups but don't like the price.

181116,B007Y59HVM,ACNQRJWEE2IXX,BearInStPete,1,2,5,1332288000,"Not Quite a K-Cup, but awesome coffee!","First of all, the coffee is quite rich, and definitely appropriately labeled Fog Chaser!  Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling."

Or at least I did not find the secret yet revealed.  I love Amazon.com and am a high volume customer but folks, you can get this product at COSTCO at a significant savings.  An 80 count box at COSTCO is just around $30; unit cost is about 34 cents.  Do not hesitate because of the 80 count box.  The contents are packed 8 units to a heavy duty sealed nitrogen filled bag that will hold for over a year.  You will find the 'good until' date clearly printed on each bag.  When you cut open the bag (you will need scissors) the phenomenal fragrance of freshly ground French Roast coffee comes right at you.  If you like that rich smell of fresh ground, this will be almost as good as when you drink it after brewing.<br /><br />So is this a good coffee?  I am an old restaurant guy and I always prefer my coffee rich, dark and not bitter.  I tried virtually all the K-cup samplers available so I could do a comparison of the DARKS, BOLDS and FRENCH ROASTS I could find.  Other than a few Sumatra brews, this SF BAY product stood out at the top of the list.  That even includes the really expensive stuff that is good but not good enough to be price competitive or flavor superior. If you do not at least try this coffee in your K-Cup brewer, you are missing a unique opportunity for quality and value.  If you shop at COSTCO, you need to look for it and get the best competitive single serve French Roast around town.  You will also find that San Francisco Bay bulk coffees have been sold at COSTCO for a very long time.<br /><br />Now, about that little filter material container in place of the plastic cup you are used to seeing.  Well, the Rodgers Family who produce all the San Francisco Bay Coffees (and other labels), are independent and want us all to get their premium coffees without having to pay the Royalties to use the ""K-Cup"" brand name...and they do not want to infringe on copyright designs, so they were inspired to have this design created.

With such an attractive price I finally decided to give San Francisco Bay's Fog Chaser a chance. I was a little worried about the unique design of these cups. However, after receiving them and brewing a couple of cups of coffee I can say that there was no need to worry. I would describe this coffee as Medium roast, maybe leaning towards dark. It has a nice distinctive flavor, and the Amazon Frustration Free packaging really is frustration free. We store our open cups in a sealed container to help maintain freshness. All in all a good cup of coffee, and as long as the price remains competitive I will be a repeat customer."

I was a little worried when I saw that instead of all plastic, this actually is made out of very little plastic and the coffee is actually held in material just like regular coffee filters.  I love that they are not as destructive to the environment as the others.  The company really believes in freshness since they put these little pod/pouches in a sealed pouch and then stick them in the cardboard.<br /><br />Now mind you I am truly wedded to my Green Mountain Dark Magic, but I decided to try this because of the price.  And I'm not one bit sorry I did, I feel a tad guilty for semi-abandoning my Green Mountain!

Maybe about the same as Dark Magic.<br /><br />Coworkers agreed that we'll probably buy more since we don't have to do any coupons from other vendors to get good coffee at this price."

You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.<br /><br />OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.<br /><br />I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.<br /><br />I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.  This guy is a whiz in the a.m.  I'm happy if I find the sink on the first try.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best pre-coffee coffee I've ever had.

The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what ""smell"" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.

It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.

We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.

It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.

I tried peeling the tops and bought the new lids to iron on (too messy and time consuming) and I do have the refillable cups you can use repeatedly, but those are messy, too.  I always thought the goal of a Keurig was a quick single cup of good coffee without the mess or fuss of a regular coffee maker. During a recent browsing day on Amazon, I ordered this product.  Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue!  Spouse and I love the coffee, it is rich (read strong) enough for him, and tasty for me (I add a little hot water to mine.)  If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom.  The cups come in sealed bags of 10 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 80 is no problem.  This purchase was cheaper than my local Costco, too.  I also bought the decaf, and it is great as well.  Definitely a recommend!"

Living alone I love K-cups ability to brew a single cup instead of wasting a whole pot. I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones.

They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out."

When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day.

It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can ""double-brew"" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this. It may be too strong if you like lighter roasts or flavored coffees.<br /><br />Tastes great, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than other k-cups!"

Folks, I have tried so many varieties from Instant to Drip to K cups, and the list goes on.  Hopefully, the reader gets the picture...I love my coffee.  Yet, I am not sure what this ""stuff"" is.  Here is my experience...<br /><br />First, I get the shipment.  Open it up, and I must admit, I do like the nice box the coffee arrives in.  I do appreciate the added note on the box from the Robinson Family along with their mission statement.<br /><br />""Taste the Difference - Make a Difference - Community Aid Program"" and there is more information on the side of the box which really sort of made me ""feel good"" about my purchase.  The Robinson Family goes on to state ""Offering the best value to you, our customer.  Treating our employees, suppliers, and customers as if they were part of our family.""  I mean all this really made me feel good and I was glad I had purchased a product where a ""family"" supported others...<br /><br />Yet, that is where it ended.  I opened the box, cut open the plastic sealed containers this ""cups"" come in, and grabbed my first little strange looking but new looking ""k cup"".  Please note, as others have said, these are completely different than an actual ""k cup"", but I thought unique and liked the design....<br /><br />UNTIL...yes, UNTIL...I hate to write this, but the very first thing I noted on the side of this ""bag cup"" was something that looked like a bug!!  It politely dropped in the palm of my hand, and since it was not ""wiggling"", I figured I could examine it very closely.  I did....<br /><br />YUCK!  It was some sort of freaking small, slim BUG!!  I thought maybe it was my ole' eyes, but had my son examine it and he confirmed my verdict....<br /><br />Did I go ahead and try the coffee???  Well, again, I hate to admit this, but I figured the bug could not ""kill"" me, so yes...I went ahead and tried the other ""cup"" things (honestly, I don't know what to call these little cups"").  My first reaction was just ""disgust""...The flavor was weak and the cream and sugar simply diluted to the bottom of the cup.  Nothing like the Rev K Cups or other K cups I had used...<br /><br />So, I went to the computer to write a review...no, not today I thought...I wanted to be fair, because, again, I felt a part of the ""Family"" the manufacturer had written about on the box...and maybe the ""bug"" was still in my mind!<br /><br />Thus, here I sit today several days later, and just finished another of these cups....and after using a few of the things...I just honestly cannot understand why all the high positives written by other reviewers?  Honestly?  I am trying to like these things due to the price and the ""Family"" caring thing...but, this coffee is simply too weak and does not taste like ""coffee"" to me.  In comparison, it sort of reminds me of an off the wall instant coffee on the weak scale...<br /><br />Folks, all of you who have written such positive reviews...trust me, I want to be open minded...I want to like this coffee.  I tried smaller cups on my K cup machine, and it simply gets worse...<br /><br />So, in conclusion, maybe I got a ""bad box""?  I mean should there have been a ""bug"" in it to begin with??  Even with that...get past the bug issue...where is the flavor?  Why does the cream and sugar simply dissolve to the bottom of the cup leaving a bad looking residue as you get to the last sip?  It dissolves ""into the coffee"" with other brands...<br /><br />I love the price, and wish I could like this...is there another type other than the ""Fog Chaser""???  Would like to stay with the Robinson Family, but not left in the ""Fog"" as this is sort of how I feel trying to drink this coffee .....""Fog Chaser""????  Well, I am definitely ""chasing the Fog""...trying to understand how this is called ""coffee""????<br /><br />I will continue through this box the best I can, and ""if"" I find one of the cups different, then in all fairness, I will update this review to treat the ""Robinson Family"" fair...And yes, I guess maybe I am crazy to drink through all these things since the bug was on the first one, but I figure the hot water should kill any harmful bacteria...hope I am right??  But, again, I want to emphasize, it is not the ""bug"" that is causing my dislike of this ""wattery, weak...very odd coffee""....."

They are to be used in the Keurig machines but have a filter casing, not plastic like the regular K- cups, which is not a problem.  The coffee tasted terrible.

181226,B007Y59HVM,A3P7U2VHXKJESY,J.P.,0,3,2,1326412800,"Good coffee, not a K-Cup","While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant."

Crema is a flavorful, aromatic, reddish-brown froth made when air bubbles combine with fine-ground coffee's soluble oils.

Barkan ""Holly B.""",2,2,3,1343606400,"Not the best, not the worst.","I recently ordered this because I was excited about the reduced plastic in the packaging. Interestingly, the day I ordered it my husband came home with the same brand from the grocery store, so I've now tried 2 different flavors. I would give both the same review. The coffee is okay. It's not horrendous, as some people seem to imply, and its not amazing either. The smell is good and smells like nice fresh coffee when you open the box. The flavor is nice enough too. I also love super strong coffee. I drink Revv, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, etc. I would not say that this coffee rivals them, but it is stronger than some other medium roast coffees.<br /><br />Big reasons why I wouldn't give this 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The coffee gets very watered down when brewed on a larger cup size. I usually do the 10 oz size and this coffee just doesn't cut it for that. I feel it becomes more like coffee flavored water at that point. 8 oz is better, but its ideal at 6 oz. So, now I just save it for when I want a small cup.<br /><br />2) There is a strange film that brews with the coffee. You can see it floating on top and it sticks to the sides of the mug when you tilt it, so there is like a ring of residue that gets left around the edge where the coffee moved away. You can also see it as darker specks floating on top after you add creamer. I don't know what this is. I have no other coffee that does this. It doesn't really change the taste or texture or anything, but I just don't like it.<br /><br />I think the packaging is a big plus though. I am not sure why the cups being open is such an issue for people. I just put all mine in a zip lock bag (that I can just keep reusing) to keep it air tight. It's really not that difficult. Plus I think it's important to cut down on plastic waste.<br /><br />So all in all, I do plan to buy this coffee again. I like that I can reduce waste and I like it enough that its good for a midday refresher since it has to be a small cup. We are also on a tight budget so that helps as well. However, I don't see myself replacing all my coffee with it, because I want a much larger and stronger cup of coffee in the morning and brewing two of these eliminates both the value and the positive aspects of less waste."

It actually tastes fresher to me than other K-Cups, possibly because it arrives packed in a plastic bag which seems airtight until opened."
181254,B007Y59HVM,A1GRFKOIAYG1C6,"John Morrison ""Curmudgeon""",2,2,5,1330646400,"Not your average K-cup, but worth a taste","I have my concerns about this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: It tastes good. Fog Chaser is a little more robust than I like for a morning blend (I tend toward a Dunkin Donuts style coffee first thing in the AM), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. The nonstandard pods fit into my B70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) Grove Square. Yes, I'd buy these again.<br /><br />Now the negatives. As has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. There's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. I've heard concerns about the Keurig success causing more spent K-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; I'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. So a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />However, one of the charms of Keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: I've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. Oxygen is the enemy of coffee. Old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. Keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the San Francisco Bay Coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. The bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. After all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (I can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. If you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, I'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />My concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the Keurig system is a godsend. For example, I dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when I visited. Having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. These, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />So in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. Keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. Companies that go through a whole lot of K-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most K-cups."

I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe."

While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma.

Anbinder ""14850.com editor""",36,53,2,1324512000,"WARNING - open mesh coffee pods, NOT K-Cups","I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box."

Yes it is nice that the product uses less plastic but that is only a side note the quality of the coffee is top notch.

I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a ""crema"" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely.

I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more ""green"" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging.

There have been no problems with grounds in the cup as sometimes happens with regular K-Cups or the refillable K-Cups.<br /><br />The 80 count box came with a reusable storage container that holds a week of pods. It's just a flimsy, clear plastic container but it does keep the coffee fresh."

I'm a bargain hunter and have considered going back to my drip coffee due to the rising prices of K cups.I read all the reviews,and feeling there was nothing to lose I debated between French Roast and Fog Chaser. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the ""netted"" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me. Obviously, I am a San Francisco Bay Coffee fan. If you choose to try this product, I'm pretty sure you will be pleasantly surprised."
181293,B007Y59HVM,A10PEXB6XAQ5XF,Michael Gallagher,1,1,5,1340928000,Excellent Taste and More Robust Brewing with These Type of Pods,"I decided to give these a try based on the price, the favorable reviews here on Amazon, and its sales rank in the K-cup store.  I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!"

I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable."

Their Rainforest version has a more mellow taste that is also very good, but it is weaker strength than Fog Chaser.  The price for any of the versions, especially for the ""subscribe and save"", is very good.

189341,B001EO5Q64,A2L7UE9O293Q2W,J. Garcia,5,6,5,1277769600,Love Love Love this stuff!,"I bought Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil from a local natural foods market after reading so many good reviews on Amazon.com and the many uses for this awesome oil on the internet. The first thing I did was put some in my dry hair to absorb for a few hours. After shampooing, my hair was MUCH softer than it was before. I've put few drops on my ends 2 more times since then and my hair is soooo soft now! In that time, I've used it as a face and body moisturizer and it does NOT make my dry acne prone face break out. Be careful though, coconut oil is not a thick oil so a little goes a loooong way (which is a great thing!). Smells SO good on my skin, gives it a slight, mild toasted coconut smell.<br />I've cooked eggs, kielbasa and pulled pork with it so far and it makes the tastes of those things richer, which is a pleasant surprise. No overpowering coconut taste, just a slight ""ummph"" to the flavor of things I've cooked so far with it.<br /><br />I even like licking the spoon after I've dipped it in the container to get some oil.<br /><br />Right now, I keep it on my kitchen counter in a cruet (oil drizzler) and it is liquid which is fine by me. Will start solidify below 75 degrees though so don't be alarmed if your clear oil starts to become cloudy every once in awhile.<br /><br />I purchased one 15 oz. jar from my local health food store for $9.99 so 2 for $12.17 is a great deal! Will purchase again :)"
189342,B001EO5Q64,A3KG5Q302QXSCD,M. Wang,7,9,4,1256688000,"Near Perfect for popcorn, experimental for other things","Edit:  Added a second part.<br />===============================================<br />Original Post<br />I use this with the whirleypop, which I'm expecting to break any minute, but that aside, this makes near perfect popcorn.  The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word ""miracle"" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a ""miracle"".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a ""miracle"" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight."

There is definitely some coconut taste due to the fact that it's a virgin product but that doesn't bother me at all. The taste and texture are alot more pleasant than other brands of coconut oil I have used in the past. I usually use it when making scrambled eggs or other assorted foods on the skillet. I can sometimes detect a little sweetness but I like it, especially with something salty. I have also used this oil to make chocolate truffles and baked goods and it has always come through like a champ. I highly recommend this as a great oil for any culinary purpose and I will definitely buy it again."

This brand is leaps and bounds superior to all the other coconut oils out there. It has comparatively little greasiness on the skin and absorbs quite fast. I use it as a moisturizer, shaving cream, makeup remover, hair conditioner, scar treatment, to relive itching on bug bites, lube (no latex condoms though please), foot treatment at night, massage oil, and I even use it on my pet hedgehog for his dry skin. It has  great texture and faint coconut smell that is pleasing and not overpowering. I don't regularly eat it or use it to cook with, but I have tasted it and it is nearly flavorless. I recommend this to nearly every person I talk to."
189345,B001EO5Q64,AEY3H25KW4DL8,Brown Skin Lady,2,2,5,1344643200,Excellent coconut oil,"I keep 1 in the bathroom, 1 in the kitchen. For folks with kinky hair this is a wonderful sealant to lock moisture into your hair. Think it's most useful if placed in hair AFTER a leave-in conditioner or other moisturizer. By itself, doesn't seem to moisturize - just sort of sits on the surface, looking greasy for a while. So after you've moisturized, rub a small amount of Nutiva between your hands and then lightly work it through your hair, with attention to your ends. Give it a few minutes to soak in to avoid the soul glo look: at first it will of course be shiny, but it soaks in very quickly and then your hair just looks lush and healthy (unless you get heavy handed with it - then it will stay looking greasy. Go light...you can always add a little more later). It's also a good sealant to use on your skin after putting on body moisturizer.<br /><br />Great in the kitchen too. Can use in pretty much anything, with excellent results. Recommend using this for anything you're going to heat, and saving the olive oil for cold dishes. There are a million other uses for coconut oil, so it's worth taking some time to look into. Cold pressed, virgin, organic coconut oil is what you want. Like with most oils, this one will change consistency depending on the temperature, but even when it solidifies, it will quickly liquify again if you rub it between your hands or heat it. Price of this product seems to vary, would take a quick look to find the most reasonable deal. The scent is earthy, nutty, and not too strong - not overwhelming like chemical coconut scents. Unless you have a sensitivity to/dislike of coconut, think you will like the scent."

I like the fact it's organic extra virgin--no extra stuff added. I use this oil about as much as I do olive oil. It has a nice flavor; it's not overwhelmingly coconutish. In fact, you can barely taste the coconut--it just adds a nice, mellow flavor to your food.<br /><br />My favorite thing to use it for is popcorn! I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper a few months ago, along with some Amish Country Popcorn, after a friend told me how great it was. YES! It makes the BEST popcorn (see my review for that for more details!) The oil melts nicely and quickly. It doesn't burn easily, so it's great for making foods that require high, fast heat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!<br /><br />PS- The popcorn is Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Gourmet Popping Corn."

My skin: coconut oil moisturizes my skin very well. It is also a very good makeup remover. I use coconut oil on any dry spots on my skin, but I do not use it on my face. While many people have no problems using coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, it can be a problem for someone with acne prone skin.<br /><br />3. Cooking: coconut oil is great for cooking. It adds a really great flavor to a bowl of oatmeal. I sometimes even add some into my coffee. I've made cookies and bars with coconut oil and have had great results."

Expect Greasy Delivery in Hot Weather.,"The benefits of organic Coconut Oil are endless and this brand is wonderful.  Another reviewer had warned about ordering cocounut oil in hot weather days. Coconut oil is liquid at room temperature, so it'll probably leak & evaporate from jar at 85*F+  (wildly guessing here).<br /><br />If you look at the same item in FL store shelves, their jars are kinda greasy too especially in the spring/summer months.<br /><br />I got my shipment today. Amazon did a superb job in packaging. And yet no matter how well packaged, the jars in bubble wrap, plastic bag & box, leaked the same.<br /><br />Gotta expect the oil to leak from jar while in transit in hot weather and also be prepared to do some smart cleaning upon receipt.  I suggest leaving jars in bubble wrap + bag. Place all on paper towels and put inside fridge for 1/2 hr. When oil is solid, remove wrappings. Rinse jars under warm water, use oil residue on hands, arms, face (never let a good crisis go to waste!)  Inspect lids & seals. All should be intact, maybe just a tad oily. After rinsing & once product is partially solid, there should be NO leaking from anywhere. If so, then the jar must be cracked. Remove oil and place in another container -- a glass jar would be best.<br /><br />The product is great and perhaps worth the hassle if ordering in hot days. Another option, would be to place orders in cooler months. No mess. No stress."

I learned that coconut oil consists of predominately medium-chain fatty acids which digest more easily, are the kinds of fats in mother's milk, and are preferentially used by the liver as a source of fuel to produce energy.<br /><br />Cooking can significantly affect many fats and oils causing the formation of toxic compounds. However, coconut oil is safe for cooking because it is the oil with the largest amount of saturated fatty acids and the least amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Ninety-two percent is saturated and only 1.5 percent is polyunsaturated. You can use coconut oil for cooking without having to worry about it harming your health. It is so stable you can reheat the oil and use it several times without damaging it. Not only does coconut not form harmful toxins when heated, but it also has many health benefits.<br /><br />For more information on coconut oil benefits, I recommend Dr. Bruce Fife's books on the subject.<br /><br />I love the taste of this oil and use it almost exclusively for cooking.

I was VERY surprised buy the wonderful taste it gives the popcorn, I can't believe I never realized at the movies that the reason the popcorn taste so good is that bit of coconut flavor to it. It also left my popcorn machine very clean, when the other oil coated the whole machine in a greasy gunk. Combine with Eden Organics Organic popcorn kernels from Amazon for a total organic popcorn. I received a mini popcorn machine like you would find in a theater for Christmas. After going through the sample packs of yellow gunk oil that came with it for popping I searched for a more healthier and natural way to make popcorn. I read a lot about different oils people use, but one thing was always the same, if you want it to taste like at the movies use coconut oil."

I use this as a hair and skin conditioner. It is much easier to apply than extra virgin olive oil, but works just as well for healthy hair growth. As for my skin, I've stopped buying regular lotion because it softens and conditions it on its own.<br /><br />I can't offer a review about cooking with this oil, although coconut oil in general tolerates higher temperatures than other oils due to its primarily solid state.

Ignoring the fact that it's in a plastic container, this stuff is awesome. It smells and taste just like when my mother makes coconut oil so I know that it's organic and all natural. All the other oils I've purchased usually have a strong overpowering smell and usually remain liquid even in cold temperatures letting me know they aren't good. I've made my own but it only makes a bit so I thought I'd try Nutiva and I'm glad I did. This stuff has the light nutty smell and solidifies quickly true to coconut oil.

Don't mistake healthy for bland tasting either, the coconut flavor actually enhances the dishes I cook. The oil is solid at room temp, it quickly turns to a liquid when heated. I also use this product as a leave in hair conditioner. This is no exaggeration when I say it works better than any commercial hair conditioner product I've tried. It works well as a facial moisturizer too. To use it on your face or hair, just put some of the oil in your palms, it will be solid so to liquefy it rub both palms together in a circular motion, after a few seconds you will have a natural, effective skin and haircare solution in the palm of your hands."

What I didn't like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that Nutiva now uses for the coconut oil. I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar. This was not a problem with the previous jars. Nutiva should address this problem right away.

While I hope that changes soon, I need to get my ""fix"".  Nutiva has a clean, lightly coconut scented product with good prices for the size. It's organic and cold pressed so heat hasn't rendered away any antioxidants and benefits. I use it like butter on bagels, and for my cooking oil. I use olive oil for salads because coconut oil is a solid under about 70 to 75. I also use it for oil pulling for dental health. I mildly dislike the plastic container but I've read that the grade is good and won't leach chemicals into the contents."

Well, ran out of Louana brand and found that I had a bit of this left from my last order.  When I opened it up the smell of coconut was a pleasant surprise.  I opened the louana tub again, no smell.  I love making popcorn with this oil and one of the things I liked was the coconut scent and flavor, mild though it is.

The consensus seems to be that it has a smoother texture and stronger coconut flavor. So if you're eating it by the spoonful or spreading it on toast or want a shot in your smoothie, that would be the way to go, if you don't mind paying a little more.<br /><br />I'm mostly using coconut oil for cooking, so I like the more subtle fragrance of Nutiva. I can use it for most anything that calls for canola oil without everything tasting of coconut--mostly it just adds a certain savory quality, like umami, and makes your kitchen smell amazing.<br /><br />It's also great as a deep-conditioning treatment for hair. I leave it in for a few hours and my hair feels soft and unprocessed after washing it out with my regular shampoo. I love it because it changes the texture of my hair without weighing it down."

My mane is definitely softer to touch although it is typically not course or difficult to manage. I just got it last week so will see how it goes. The hot oil treatment with coconut oil is next on my to-do list. Careful when you use it on hair though, when I don't wrap my hair, I wake up with zits (prolly from the oil on my pillow).

I was very pleased to see that it absorbs quickly and it leaves your skin super soft. I'm prone to acne and I have yet to have a breakout from using it. It smells awesome too. I'm not sure about the effect it has on diaper rash. I think it's more for prevention than treatment.<br />  The second jar, I keep in the fridge (it stays pretty hard in the fridge)and periodically eat a small spoon of it to help my acid reflux (I'm 24 weeks pregnant) and it tastes delicious. It's just like eating coconut flakes without all the sugar.

I apply a little amount to my hair, just enough to cover it from the roots to the tips, and a little to the scalp, and let it on for a couple of hours. After that I wash my hair a couple of times to perfectly remove all the ""grease"", and for a few days, even after a one or two additional washes, my hair feels so full of body and shiny that I love it (If you have few hairs you must make the most of them!!!). Be careful: if you apply too much and do not wash your hair properly you might get the contrary effect (a greasy dead hair stuck to your scalp)<br /><br />It smells so good! just like a tropical sweet... I tasted it and it is not bad but it certainly smells better than it tastes... as a matter of fact I would say that it was almost tasteless to me. I read about the benefits of oil pulling (rinsing your mouth with it and making it pass between your teeth to remove bacteria) and it is not disgusting at all, I will continue and see how it turns out. This oil pulling alternative has also proven useful for a relative that has Alzheimer's disease as a complement to brushing his teeth, which he sometimes finds difficult to accomplish properly. Allegedly, oil pulling provides better results than using Listerine or similar mouth washes, which by the way can also be ""too spicy"" for children and the picky elderly because of their content of alcohol.<br /><br />I have also applied it over rashes in the skin and minor scratches. Many people cook with it too, although I have not tried it for cooking."
189439,B001EO5Q64,A3JVCRSVH20SLJ,Amazon Fan,1,1,5,1330473600,Excellent product!!!,"Nutiva's brand of organic EV hexane-free coconut oil is awesome. First, I admit it's the first and only one I've tried, but after reading scores of reviews and my holistic health practitioner suggesting I take in 2 Tbsp. a day, I wanted the best. And at Amazon, you get the best prices, especially with Subscribe & Save (how great is that?)!<br /><br />When I opened the jar the very first time, I was amazed at the deliciously fresh coconut aroma. It's intoxicating! I do like coconut, so that helps. But it took me a while to get up the nerve to heat it up and pour it into my frozen fruit smoothie (frozen banana, strawberries, blueberries, juice). I thought somehow it'd solidify back up and I'd get big chunk-o-fat globules in my shake. Not at all!<br /><br />When I heated it up on the stove so that it'd liquify, the scent was of toasted coconut (mmmm, so yummy), so I thought it'd taste great in my smoothie. What surprised me was that it added no taste at all. I'm now using it every day, as suggested.<br /><br />Then it took me a while to try frying with it because I figured it'd impart mild coconut flavor to my savory dishes (potatoes, chicken, eggs), which I wouldn't want. But I just tried it over the past two days, a little with scrambled eggs and a lot with searing boneless breasts of chicken (which were finished in the oven on a tray coated with more coconut oil). I tasted zero coconut flavor in any of it! I am so psyched about this! So now I'll be using organic olive oil for dressings and other raw applications and coconut oil with nearly everything else.<br /><br />Also, I read that the plastic tubs it comes in are BPA-free...fabulous! Haven't tried baking with it yet, but I did use it on my very chapped hands, and it was great. Smells like ole Hawaiian Tropic!!! I love that beach smell!<br /><br />I highly and enthusiastically recommend Nutiva Coconut Oil...it is awesome!!!!"

I've tried several brands, but nothing tastes as clean and pure as this.  There is a definite undertone of coconut, but I like the flavor, even when frying eggs or eating it on cinnamon raisin toast. I recently had bloodwork done and my HDL (the good cholesterol) was an impressive 77---anything over 39 is considered in range; over 50 is heart protective).  I attribute this great HDL number to using only coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in my cooking & drinking green tea.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer is a great deal; I really like the 2 pack of these smaller (15 oz) jars.  We're a small household and I like keeping one jar sealed while using the other.  Keep in mind that coconut oil is different than other oils--it is solid at temperatures under 72, so it will look something like shortening in the wintertime.  Still tastes great and is wonderful to use in all kinds of cooking.<br /><br />One more important detail:  this is an organic, COLD PRESSED coconut oil.  Others may be organically grown, but I've found some brands are hydrogenated to make them solid at room temperature (I won't go into all the reasons this is not a ""good thing"").

I fry eggs in it, and the coconut taste is subtle. Any ethnic dish that requires sauteeing or saucing and can benefit from a fresh coconut flavor, this is useful. I've cooked meats in it, as well. If you hate the smell/taste of coconut, obviously, this is not for you.<br /><br />This brand, Nutiva, is organic and virgin. It smells so good. And I have an old jar that I never finished (really big one), and nearly two years later, after sitting right by the stove, it still smells fresh, like Cuban coconut candy my mom used to make.

189444,B001EO5Q64,A30L4Y3Y16ZA73,K. Santanen,56,56,5,1278115200,"Excellent, Clean-Tasting Coconut Oil","First things first: the flavour of this coconut oil is wonderful. Very clean on the tongue with just a slight back hint of coconut flavour. YES, this WILL slightly flavour some of your dishes to taste faintly of coconut if the dish is not heavily spiced. When I use coconut oil in place of butter for many Ethiopian and Indian dishes, I don't really notice any coconut flavour--but these are heavily spiced cuisines and so the sheer level of spice involved will cover up the delicate coconut flavour of this oil. In baking, however, there is a wonderful little hint of it. When I've made cookies and cakes using this in place of shortening or butter, many people have commented that something felt different about the dessert, but they couldn't put their finger on it right away until I would suggest coconut. I say all of this, though, in case someone who absolutely HATES coconut is considering using coconut oil as a part of their diet. While it has many great health benefits, if you cannot stand the flavour of coconut in any shape or form, you probably will not enjoy this product. I personally enjoy the added depth and dimension is gives my food, as well as the fact it's cholesterol free.<br /><br />If you're thinking this wouldn't taste like anything, then you're thinking of what is called ""RBD coconut oil"", that is to say, coconut oil which has been refined, bleached, and deodorised. This is not that product, and in my opinion, is far superior to any RBD coconut oil you could find.<br /><br />Now, the health benefits. Coconut gets props for being cholesterol free. Many people want to downplay its wonderfulness by pointing out that it is loaded in saturated fats. However! The saturated fats found in coconut oil are mostly medium-chain fatty acids, which bind together to form medium-chain triglycerides. Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are much easier for the body to break down and process than long-chain triglycerides, which are the saturated fats that are usually predominant in our diets. Because MCTs are so easily broken down in the body, they don't put a great strain on your pancreas or digestive system. Coconut oil is not a cure-all, however. It's not some miracle food (IMO), but I do think it should be seen as a healthy, viable alternative to butter and some cooking oils. Should it replace these other oils and butter outright? No, I don't think so. But I think it deserves a place of respect alongside your butter and olive oil in the kitchen."

It has a light coconut hint at times.  I use it for popping corn and I can't taste any coconut, other items like meats or veggies sometimes have a hint of coconut...it's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />I thought I would save washing a spoon each time I used this and put in a clear, plastic spoon (Kirkland brand) into the jar so I could reuse it.  DON'T KEEP PLASTIC IN YOUR COCONUT OIL!!! About 1 week later I went to make popcorn and I pulled out the handle of the spoon with no bottom of the spoon to be found!!!

I combine it with pure organic cold pressed olive oil- my hair loves it.<br /><br />The quality and texture are great.<br />I like the containers- they're plastic jars which makes storing them a breeze.<br /><br />I also use this on my skin sometimes, and it works GREAT.  It really saturates into the skin- makes it very smooth and extremely soft. I actually use the olive oil/coconut oil combo on my skin, so I guess its both products at work... but either way it goes it'll leave you with softer skin.<br /><br />It's a little messy for me because I have to transfer it into a smaller bottle, but I just started using the top of a straw/sippy cup as a funnel and that helps. The smell is strong, if you like coconut you'll love this. I'm not that huge on it, so at times its a bit much for me.<br /><br />This is the best deal on on this product you'll find- 2 for $16 (and free shipping if you spend $25)... but I still wish it was more like 2 for $10."

189449,B001EO5Q64,AGTBEWGF0VHHA,Observant I,22,23,4,1298592000,"Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free","I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar."

I use it primarily for frying eggs and other pan fried things, and I love that the flavor is very mild and not overwhelming in coconut.  I was happy to learn that it's a healthy substitute for butter, so I look forward to using it in other ways."

It gives food just the right amount of aroma and flavor. Nutiva is a major brand you can trust, though I've tried & used other brands from local healthfood stores as well. It annoys me that some books & health professionals still knock coconut oil as a fat to avoid on the premise that it's a naturally saturated fat, when in fact it's a tremendously healthy product. SOme say that it helps your body converts fat into energy better as well."

The color is beautiful and white, and the smell is fresh and doesn't have the ""off"" scent some of the oils have. I love that it is organic and unrefined. I use it in cooking sometimes, but mostly, I use it as an after-shower body and face moisturizer. I rub it all over my body and then after about 20 minutes, use a dry washcloth to very lightly blot the excess off, so when I dress, I don't get oil on my clothes. This regimen makes a world of difference for my ""chicken skin""--you know, those tiny red, raised dots a person gets on their skin when it's dry--keratosis pilaris, I believe it's called.  As a woman, I do NOT find them attractive at all. So, I highly recommend this oil for cooking, and for a wonderful moisturizer. Makes your skin feel young again--very smooth and not sticky at all. I find the price is great on Amazon too--what a bonus!"

The two containers were bubble wrapped with no other packaging around them so they were rolling around in the box while in transit. I called Nutiva who said that Amazon was the seller and packager of their product. (The guy also said that Amazon has some of the worst packaging of items like this in the industry.) The Nutiva guy said that I got a really good price on their product, but with results like I had, I guess I didn't get a good deal as only one container was sealed and safe to use. I am a huge Amazon fan for many things, but unless I get assurances for packaging improvements, I will hesitate before ordering perishable items in the future."

But don't worry, if you don't love the smell of coconut, it fades pretty quickly. I then started using it as an oil treatment for my hair with fantastic results.

I have mid-back length, curly, Caucasian hair and this stuff really hydrates and softens my hair. It doesn't make your hair look greasy or flat if you use only a little bit when you have some wild frizz.  For hot oil treatments I get my hair wet then use enough to saturate my hair.

So far, I have used it for (1) extremely dry skin on my face and around my hairline. I could see an improvement after just one day and it's continued until I no longer have patches of dry skin and the skin on my face is glowing. (2) I severely burnt my tongue tasting some soup and the next day it was so painful I could not eat. I coated my tongue several tiimes that day in the coconut oil and it was completely well on the third day. (3) On my grand daughters diaper rash and on her dry flaky feet. Her feet were peeling they were so dry and we cleared it up in a week with the coconut oil. (4) I coated my dry hair in the coconut oil and left it on all day and then shampooed it out before going to bed. My hair was soft and shiny the next day to the point that several people asked me what I had done to my hair. Now I regularly soak my hair in the oil and my hair is beautiful. (5) I made a face scrub with the oil and sugar and it works wonderfully for getting the dead skin off my face and feet at a fraction of the cost of the expensive scrubs and works better and smells good too.<br /><br />The oil does not stay on your skin, it is absorbed quickly and does not stain your clothes or bedding. I ordered two tubs with Subscribe and Save and the price was a real bargain except my sister begged me out of one of my tubs, so now I have to re-order quickly. I don't want to be out. I keep a small jar of the oil on my desk and use it several times a day on my hands and elbows. Those rough ugly elbows will dissappear in a week and you will have smooth white elbows if you just rub some oil in once a day.<br /><br />I have not used the oil for any kind of cooking because that is not the reason I wanted it, but I have read that it is great for use as a cooking oil. I know my grand daughter loves to stick her finger in the jar and lick the oil off. She loves it and I know it will not hurt her.<br /><br />Would I order this again? Yes and yes. I would and have it on permanent order with Subscribe and Save. I don't want to ever be without it again."

It sounds funny that a person would use this as you would vegetable or olive oil, but it is amazing.  I put a scoop in the pan and thought I would start slowly and try frying up some thin potato wedges to start and see what this oil was all about. It heated up quickly and the aroma was the beautiful smell of tropical coconuts.  My first concern after that was that the food would have a hint of coconut taste, but that was not the case at all.  The oil fried the potatoes perfectly.  I barely patted the potatoes. Didn't need to.  They were not greasy at all!!!!!!Nutiva organic coconut oil is my new favorite kitchen must have.  I am so impressed."
189558,B001EO5Q64,A33REC3J2JU2EL,D. Figueroa,10,10,5,1282348800,"Excellent Product, The Best Oil You Can Use","The health benefits of coconut oil have been reported widely by now. I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.<br /><br />I have found this brand to be the purest coconut oil on the market, at least among those I've been able to find and try. The price is fabulous, can't beat it.<br /><br />The oil will solidify at lower temperatures, it did that often when I lived in Texas. You just scoop it out and use it the same way. Once it sits in a room temp over 70 degrees, it tends to stay clear and in its liquid form. It hasn't solidified at all since I've been in subtropical Mexico. It's not white when in liquid form.<br /><br />I avoid all artificial fats and use coconut and extra virgen olive oil for most cooking and baking now. I have no problem with natural fats as I follow a mostly low-carb diet nowadays, but I still prefer non-animal sources for most fat. The fact that coconut oil has been shown to aid with lowering blood sugar is a big plus for me. I know a lot of people who stir it into their coffee or find other ways to ingest at least 3TB per day, I probably don't get that much, though I know I should.<br /><br />Be aware that this oil doesn't taste much like coconut, important for me because I LOATHE the flavor of coconut. It does smell like it, but I haven't found that it adds any taste at all to what I cook.<br /><br />A caveat: coconut oil has a smoke point that's about as low as olive oil, I believe it's 350 to 375 degrees, so this is not an oil that's suitable for deep-frying. You'll have to stick with peanut oil for that.<br /><br />I've had the second jar open for about 5 months now on the counter and have not noticed any degradation of the smell or cooking results for this oil. It should last quite well when stored unopened, as well.<br /><br />You can also use this as a moisturizer, I've tried it and it does leave my skin VERY soft."

Williams,13,14,5,1272067200,Best Brand for Coconut Oil,"Update: February 2012 I told my friend about how to use this product for cooking and how it was helpful for weight loss result - May 2012 she has lost 2 dress sizes and she has more energy.  Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits.  It's not an over powering oil.  It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor.<br /><br />It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover,  a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap.<br /><br />Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin.  Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming.<br /><br />It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg.  I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food.  I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies.<br /><br />Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness.  After trying other brands of coconut oil, none has compared to the remarkable pureness and flavor of Nutiva."

It tastes good in the mouth and after swishing for 15 minutes each night it seems to have helped my gums feel better and brushing no longer hurts the gums. But I also changed a few things in my routine like using Sensodyne Pronamel tooth paste (big help) and the new Cinnamon Listerine Total care. - I have not used to oil/paste for cooking at all but I can see it being great for baking and using in sweets that call for oils. For oral care it takes about 1 minute to turn into an oil in your mouth and leaves your mouth tasting nice and sweet. So before romantic night of kissing I would highly recommend this paste prior to kissing! Just be sure you do not swallow this stuff as it is very high in fat but if you are constipated it will help ""ease your troubles"" if you do swallow some of it."

Mono fats like olive and coconut are healthier fats than even sunflower, vegetable, and canola oils, however olive oil doesn't tolerate the higher heats for frying/pan frying and some people don't like the way it tastes in baked goods.  Coconut oil doesn't contribute to slowing of the thyroid like vegetable oils can and tolerates the higher heats of frying that olive oils can't.

Google it and you will be amazed!  I knew that I only wanted to use Organic & Extra Virgin coconut oil.  I did a price comparison and this was the best price anywhere especially when I signed up for ""Subscribe & Save"".  The smell is wonderful.  I now use it daily as my face lotion and anywhere my skin is dry.  When my 6 year old was diagnosed with Eczema, I used coconut oil instead of the prescription and it went away in a few days.  It is also fantastic for cooking and baking.  I use it as a butter substitution.  I know that it costs more then vegetable oil or butter but the health benefits outweigh the price for me.  I have purchased it in a glass jar in a grocery store and wish that it came shipped to me in a glass jar instead of plastic so it would not be exposed to the toxins in the plastic.

I opened the second jar at the beginning of this week and what a disappointment.  I'm not sure if the ingredients are cooked but the oil has a burnt horrid taste to it.  Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil.  We had to throw everything away.  The taste was atrocious.  Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it.

189662,B001EO5Q64,A2GCVCOQXGL8YA,Savvy Skeptic,8,8,4,1307491200,Smart and Savory,"I used to cook with coconut oil years ago, but gave it up when the ""experts"" said it was bad for your health. I started cooking with ""healthier"" alternatives--like artificial sweeteners and chemical-loaded, aerosol-powered, partially hydrogenated cooking sprays--also on the advice of the experts.  My food tasted like a tin can, my skin was an oily mess, I felt sluggish all the time, and my jeans hugged me ever more tightly. Thankfully, the conventional wisdom has come full circle, and I've spent the last few years making the grateful journey back to a more natural--and genuinely healthy--way of living. I looked for a good, organic coconut oil at our regular grocer with no luck, so I was glad to find this brand here on Amazon.  I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that say this oil has a ""toasty"" scent.  It does, and that's why I like it.  Its warm, toasty aroma actually smells a little buttery--which is perfect if you're using this as a substitute for butter or margarine.  I've tried other oils that have a more coconut-y aroma, and they also had a sweeter, pronounced fruit-oil flavor that's great for desserts and dressings--but clashed with meats and savory dishes. This coconut oil and EVOO now get nearly equal time in my day-to-day cooking, and the warm ""toastiness"" of this oil adds a richness that enhances other flavors. I can't see it working in place of butter on something like toast or popcorn, but cooking with it gives a noticeably buttery taste to foods. This came in a pack of two tubs, which is convenient since this oil has so many uses. I can have one in the fridge to keep it solid for cosmetic/medicinal use, and the other in the cabinet as an ever-ready liquid for cooking. I'm once again enjoying all the benefits of virgin coconut oil--health, nutrition, beauty, and flavor all in one jar. These containers are fairly small, so if you use this as one of your staple oils, you may want to get a bigger size."

Squirrel""",8,8,5,1297036800,"Yummy for skin, and your palate!","(I thought I had reviewed this product already, but perhaps it was under a different size? Oh, well)<br /><br />With apologies for possible redundancy, I will simply say that this stuff is fantastic.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written about the ""clean"" taste, and I can say that after tasting this product, I wholeheartedly agree. It just tastes fresh.<br /><br />And it melts in your hand. And tastes terrific in food.<br /><br />It DOES have a delicious fresh scent, but make no mistake, it does NOT smell like suntan oil. If you wear it on your skin, you will not smell like the stuff that comes in a brown bottle. It actually fades relatively quickly, but no one will accuse you of rolling around in coconuts.<br /><br />Same goes for putting in food. I think it adds a nice depth and nuttiness, and is yummy in popcorn, as some have stated. But it is absolute HEAVEN in your fried brekkie potatoes.<br /><br />Think it is also worth mentioning that to the lower ratings reviewers, I think that ordering this product in the cooler months has merit. If it becomes liquid at 75-ish degrees, I can see that it would be easy for this stuff to leak, despite what appears to be the best efforts on the part of the manufacturer when it comes to the packaging.<br /><br />Finally, I think that the 15 oz size is fine if you are going to be using this product for topical use only, but if you plan on cooking with it as well, I would recommend getting a larger size-<br /><br />Can't wait to use this during the summer, and show off my glowing skin!<br /><br />Hope this helps!"

I usually use EVOO so I was a bit worried about the taste difference.  It defininely smells like coconut, but surprisingly, it is not overly strong.  The taste was pleasant with my veggies.  First try: delicious and easy.<br /><br />Next, I put some on my face as a moisturizer.  Again, the smell was pleasant and mild.  In the past I have also used EVOO on my skin because it is a milder moisturizer than a store bought facial moisturizer.  EVOO takes hours and hours to soak in, so I only use it at night before bed.  I thought the coconut oil would be similar.  I put in on in the evening and sat down to watch a movie.  It was completely absorbed before I even hit the sheets!  And by the time it was absorbed, the smell was gone (not that the smell of coconut on the skin would be a bad thing!) So it is lovely as a facial moisturizer.<br /><br />Then I read on the label that it could be used in place of butter, so I spread some on a cracker and tried it that way.  It was delicious!  I love the oily texture--similar to butter, with the coconut taste.  So it is a wonderful substitute for butter.<br /><br />I am sure I will find more uses for this incredible product and I can't wait to try it again."

I am 39 years old and at the age where health is something that is starting to become very important to me, as I am starting to see more and more friends and school mates with various health issues.. I have never had any health complaints and have decided to be proactive about health matters, instead of trying to ""fix"" them as they come along (as long as I'm able, of course). So, in my hours and hours of reading, I came across so many articles, websites and books devoted to coconut oil. I was shocked, that I have never heard of it and I have still not met anyone who uses it.<br /><br />So, I decided I had to try it! The main reason was I read that eating 2-4 teaspoons a day had health benefits, but I have also came across my fair share of home spa recipes for moisturizers using coconut oil as one of there main ingredients. I figured, I couldn't go wrong buying it, because if it didn't taste nice, I could still use it. I'm very happy to report that I was blown away by the taste of this coconut oil! It is not sweet at all but the coconut oil was so reminiscent of a Almond Joy candy bar to me, that I find myself going back for another spoon just to enjoy the delicious flavor..  I'm afraid I'm going to have to reorder more to use in my moisturizer recipes, as I intend to use these two containers to cook with now that I am hooked on this fantastic product.! I would recommend this coconut oil to everyone because of it's many health benefits and versatility of use (You can spread it on your toast it tastes so great or cook with it as you would any cooking oil, as well as use it on your skin. Google Coconut oil moisturizer recipes, cooking recipes and also health benefits for yourself as well as the  health benefits for your dogs if you have pets.

I was very skeptical about Nutiva but reading some good reviews and being hounded by my vegetarian friend who swears by it, I said what the hell.  It arrived from Amazon and it was in liquid form, which was to be expected as it's 96' in the shade here in Florida.  I removed the lid off the jar and before I even took the seal off, I was entranced by this wondeful coconut fragrance.  I stuck my finger in and even in liquid form, I was tasting nothing but melted coconut.  Later, when it turned into solid form I tried it again, a dap on a teaspoon, once again, nothing but coconut.

After using the Dermarest lotion a few days my heart started pumping slow and hard.<br /><br />One more thing I should mention (why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5) is because I keep forgetting that this stuff melts once it reaches 76 degrees. I inadvertently opened the jar on an angle one day thinking the coconut was still solid and the oil spilled out everywhere!! Definately my own fault, but the jar itself doesn't seem to be the best thing for containing such an oily liquid when it melts. This still would not stop me from purchasing this specific brand though, just don't be an idiot like me and you will be fine.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this brand as I've seen others in stores and they cost about 12 for 1 jar.

I've tried other brands but none of them were as good. I like this 15 ounce size better because you can use it up before it gets rancid. I had a much larger container before but it turned before I used it all up, we live in a hot climate so this is a great size to insure it stays fresh. I use one jar as a cosmetic on my skin and hair and we cook and bake with the other jar and use it in smoothies. It tastes great and is wonderful for baking when you want a little coconut flavor substitute it for the oil in the recipe. Great for curry and sambal recipes. Just know that it solidifies if it gets cold so as a salad oil it's not good because it gets hard when it hits cold food. It will do this when used as a marinade on cold seafood or meat but thats a good thing in that case because it stays hardened on the food till you get it on the grill and then it melts into it making it really tasty! There are too many uses to list and now that we know that coconut oil is a healthy oil there is no more guilt. I highly recommend this great oil."

I bought the pack of two 15 ounce jars, one for cooking and one for the cat's food, my own body, and my hair, and it's just heavenly.  It smells brilliant on, but the smell fades after awhile so it doesn't totally overpower you and everything around you, my cat likes it so much that he licks it off my legs--he needs a bit of extra fat since the raw meat you get at the grocery is generally lean--and my incredibly picky boyfriend tried some teriyaki pork I saut&eacute;ed in coconut butter and he loved it--huge surprise, since I was ready to go overboard apologizing to him for the coconut flavor.  I've made raw truffles with this, carob powder, almond extract, agave, and crushed almonds, and they turned out so yummy that SAD eaters loved them.  But--warning!--if you live in the South, and especially in the summer, be really, really careful peeling the protective bit of plastic on the top off!  Mine is permanently liquid, but especially so when it sat outside in a box waiting for me to come home.<br /><br />Another bit of advice:  buy the 54 ounces; it's a better buy, and you'll use it!<br /><br />To whoever hated the plastic jars:  yeah, you're right, but I'd still buy this coconut oil again.  No, plastic isn't ideal, but I just transfer the oil to my old glass olive oil bottles and add one of the metal dispensers on the top--easy to use and it's glass."

It has only a subtle coconut scent, which is excellent for low-heat cooking. Although it is recommended for slightly higher heat, the risk of burning the oil is high, yielding an awful synthetic taste and smell.<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my raw vegan desserts. Unfortunately, I live in Florida, which means that the coconut oil itself is always in a liquid state when kept at room temperature. Be forewarned that in the warmer months, you will have a liquid oil, since it ""melts"" at 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 C). If I make a raw cheesecake, it needs to be refrigerated immediately and cannot sit on the counter for very long, But it still does an excellent job! It is also great for the hair and skin; I keep a separate bottle in the bathroom for such uses. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, and the gentle moisturizing properties of the coconut oil do not irritate my skin or pores at all.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this product, after months of receiving it, was that it was shipped to me once with an open lid. When I received the box, it was coated in oil with a sticker from the post office that it had been received damaged by them (the postal carrier would not even carry it up for me), and damaged a box of books I had shipped separately. However, Amazon was very quick to rectify the issue.<br /><br />A few other reviewers have complained that the oil ""sweats"" and no matter what they do, the outside of the jar becomes oily. I've been through about 6 bottles of oil over the years and have only had this problem when I didn't wipe the bottle off after use. Scoop the oil out with a spoon (don't pour it from the bottle!) and you won't have a problem."

There was a piece of day old Rosemary Bread on the counter.  I remembered so many people saying this tastes good on bread so I decided to try it.  I admit I stood my the garbage pail because I was expecting to throw the piece of bread with coconut oil spread on it away.  I love this stuff but didn't think I'd go so far as to eat it straight out of the jar.  Wow.  It had a nice smooth buttery taste.  Ate it all.  By the way, Subscribe and Save is the way to go.  Doing it for a year now.  Very satisified with the service.<br /><br />Besides the cooking benefits of coconut oil I've discovered other benefits that make this a must have in my house.  For more years than I can remember I had a wart on one of my fingers.  It would come and go but finally got to the point that when it flaired up it would split, bleed, and get infected.  It was getting very hard to keep under control so had decided that I would finally have to go to a specialist and have it removed.  The last time I had an episode with it I decided to try one last thing...coconut oil. I had read coconut oil had anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.  Within 2 days the infection had started to clear up.  In less than 10 days the wart had shrunk to practically nothing.  It's been months now.  I use coconut oil on my hands every day...several times a day and haven't had a single new flair up.  After dealing with this for more than 15 years, I can barely feel where the wart was. I've used coconut oil on burns, cold sores, and callused feet (smooth as can be now).  It's also wonderful for keeping my gray hair very soft and manageable.  I had read an article about ""oil pulling"" and tryed it with coconut oil.  I won't go into that here.  Just go to Bing or EHow and check it out.  It has really improved my oral health.  The articles I read suggested oil pulling with sesame oil but I used coconut oil because of it's anti-bacterial qualities.  This is a product I wouldn't be without now."

But they had started using a little extra virgin  coconut oil on her food and she liked it.  Then they sent me a link to an article on how coconut oil can be used with pets.  I was so intrigued, I looked up more articles and saw how it can be used in a variety of ways with people.<br /><br />I ended up getting the dog - and the coconut oil.  It appeared that the ""organic, extra virgin"" was the best choice.  I bought 2 jars and have been using it  successfully in these ways:<br /><br />A few drops on my rescue's dry food, and she loves it<br />Use it to make popcorn and it really does taste like theater popcorn<br />I use it on my dry hands , body and even my face - of course I am prepared to get a lot of licks from my rescue<br />Put it on my grandson's diaper rash - it cleared it up better than diaper rash ointment<br />I have put it on my own bruises and scrapes, hard to tell if it works better than anything else, but I like that it is natural<br /><br />I know there are many other uses for it, like using it on your hair, and I am going to keep researching.

189814,B001EO5Q64,A1TUX0BB8L2RE4,Laboratory,15,24,1,1325808000,Not as Healthy as I had Hoped,"I wrote a review of this product detailing my own experience with this product and coconut oil in general. It generated a good discussion spanning 97 comments, however it was not very concise and I wished I had made my points more clearly. This is a rewrite of my initial review.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I had heard stories in the popular media about how coconut oil contains a healthy form of saturated fat. I welcomed this news because coconut oil is a fun ingredient. It has a high smoke point, a great taste, and does not go rancid.<br /><br />As a chemist, the hypothesis for why it may be healthier made sense to me. Coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats, which differ from the long chain saturated fats found in red meat. I studied lipid transport during my PhD and I think it is totally possible the body does different things with these two different chemicals.<br /><br />However it is also totally possible that the two types of saturated fat both increase one's risk of cardiovascular disease. To figure this out, I looked through the literature and spoke with people to see what proof there was.<br /><br />What I found was that the arguments that suggest medium chain saturated fats are health appeared flawed to me. Here are the arguments I have heard:<br /><br />Some people reference studies of island dwelling-people who eat diets rich in coconut fats. These people have low rates of heart disease. The problems with these studies are significant. First, these people often die earlier than Westerners, and that is why they have lower cardiovascular disease. They have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease too. This is because of the second, larger problem: there are MANY things about the life of an island-dwelling person that is different than that of a Westerner. Maybe the diet is the cause of an observed effect, maybe it is the increased exercise or different sleep pattern. You just can't draw conclusions when so many variables have changed. Islanders are just too different to use as a model.<br /><br />Some people trust books written about the subject like ""The Coconut Oil Miracle"" or ""The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil"". The problem with these books is that they are books, not studies. To prove something, you have to perform a study. To make their arguments, they often cite studies, but the studies are like the one above, typically flawed. There isn't a paper published that shows medium chain saturated fats do not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the way saturated fats do.<br /><br />There have also been citations from doctors such as Dr. Mercola. It is best to take advice from leaders in the field, rather than doctors trying to sell a book or treatement. Specifically Dr. Mercola has been admonished by the FDA for making misleading claims:  [...] Be careful who you trust.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is no evidence that medium chain saturated fats have different health effects than saturated fats. The most convincing argument in favor of coconut oil is that saturated fats themselves are not dangerous. There is controversy on this subject (just like with most medical subjects) but the vast majority of the data supports the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. To support this, here are some sources.<br /><br />1) Harvard University School of Public Health published this easy guide to fats and cholesterol:<br />[...]<br />Here they recommend that you should not decrease fat intake overall, just replace saturated fats with unsaturated, the less saturated the better.<br />2) The most convincing paper on this subject says this:<br />""Based on consistent evidence from human studies, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk, with ~10% risk reduction for a 5% energy substitution; whereas replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate has no benefit and replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat has uncertain effects. ""<br /> To restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. The authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion.<br />Further research has shown ""The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" That is a huge effect.<br />Citation is here:<br />Lipids. 2010 Oct;45(10):893-905. Epub 2010 Mar 31.<br />Saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence.<br />Micha R, Mozaffarian D.<br />Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.<br />3) Finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. The majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br />[...]<br /><br />To summarize what I learned from these conversations and articles, I now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and I know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.<br /><br />I decided to take the more conservative path and I sold the coconut oil I bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. I hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats."

Shelnutt ""Mystery Novelist""",4,7,5,1273968000,"Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.  Purchased from Swanson, my favorite purveyor of health products, this coconut oil is one of the highest qualities of life healing offerings available from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of the jar on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust this company [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG"">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray</a>.  From reading Bruce Fife's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS"">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a> I clarified my belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil and in this brand's production purity.  My experience of using this product for only 24 hours had shown results which have made me feel blessed... finally!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then ultimately seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4"">The Magnesium Miracle</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, can work as magnesium's ultimate catalyst.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my reviews on magnesium products along with the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great books and products of Magnesium and Coconut are available on Amazon, found easily using the search capacity.<br /><br />According to experts, the most important thing to know about oils and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed clearly in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods and additives defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than Mg, and in current food market and habits is usually supplied in quantities much too large, causing many illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This is clearly detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons severely deficient in magnesium [like I am] is that in its current state that fruit holds more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.  In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.  Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient. With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some books say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary foods, in order to live strong and disease free. [More details on this in my review of Bruce Fife's book hyperlinked above.]<br /><br />Magnesium seats life, coconut's the cozy catalyst, taste buds rule!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Other excellent coconut oils available on Amazon:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br />[The link above goes to a brand which has the most fantastic taste and quality of any coconut oil I've used.]<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />[The link above goes to the large size, the one I showed in my review on Bruce Fife's book]"

Anyway, I had quite a rash, and did not know at the time this was it. I tried medicated powders, diaper rash cream - thinking it may be heat rash. One night the itch was so bad, I decided to put coconut oil on it. Wow- the itch stopped and I slept through the night. Since then, two relatives came down with scabies. They went the chemical route via their doctor. I never did. As I researched this I think one of the reasons coconut oil works for me is that the oil smothers the little critters. Instead of chemically killing them, I am drowning them in coconut oil. Plus so what if the oil gets into my blood stream! My rashes healed, my skin is soft. Now the scabies take a while to leave your body, but I just kept a small container of coconut oil and if I feel an itch, I apply it there. I also read that if you put TEA TREE Oil or Clove oil ( a few drops) and use coconut oil as a carrier it may really kill scabies. So I am using a bit of Tea Tree Oil just in case, but I feel I was being cured just by using the coconut oil.<br />I gave it four stars because of the plastic container.

Leaves me feeling a little queasy. Otherwise its a nice oil and I can buy it at the local Martians grocery store. I can't eat it alone and even in my morning oatmeal its still to much. If you love an over powering taste and smell of coconut you will probably love this product if you don't then pass on this one.
189841,B001EO5Q64,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,Ghost(Ghost(M)),5,13,4,1291766400,OK stuff if used within reason.,"First, I'm not sure why it's called ""oil"": it's butter, not oil; it's solid w/o refrigeration. The consistency is translucent sorta clunky white, sorta like grated candle would look. Just like butter, it immediately melts in your hand or mouth, to say nothing of the frying pan. Smells great, tastes also nice: like, well, coconut. Supposedly it's great for cooking due to its supposedly higher heat-resistance something: it's supposed to keep its nutritional qualities when heated better than other common cooking oils. There's a rub though: with many foods you can mix and match and achieve some sort of mixed flavour -- not with this stuff! It's irrepressible: whatever you add it to -- veggies, cakes, meat, cardboard, or motor oil -- will then smell/taste like coconut and nothing beside. It overpowers every other flavour. So the only cooking variables you have left when using it is texture and sweetness (and looks, I guess). It goes very well with something that's sweet (probably because we're used to coconut being used in sweets). From what I've tried, it goes well with carrots, apples, sunflower seeds (anything nutty-tasting), stuff like that. Real good with sweet potatoes. But I would not recommed using it for cooking meat (unless you like your pork chops smelling and tasting like coconut). You can't kill this flavour, that's what I'm getting at. I'm using it carefully (not too much and in suitable combinations) and I'm happy with it so far. The product seems good, and so is the price (Added on 12/18/2010: that was the price at the time of purchase, $13.54 on Dec 2, 2010 -- and now, only two weeks later, the price on this page is $18.46, amazing, no? A 30% increase in two weeks, wow, these guys sure are optimistic about the value of their product).<br /><br />A bit of a warning: there's a megaton of unsubstantiated semi-literate BS online about miraculous powers of coconut oil. Be careful about it: coconut oil is pure saturated fat (a serving consists of 14 grams of fat, 13 of them saturated) -- and I've found no acceptable medical/scientific info in support of the healthfulness of saturated fat (while there's a lot on the opposite). What I did find was that it's not openly harmful when used in small doses: a healthy 200-lbs 40-sh male, not overweight and exercising regularly, is allowed 200 saturated-fat calories a day. A serving of coconut oil is 130 calories, but of course, you'll get saturated fats from other foods too. Another thing is that coconut oil contains no appreciable amounts of vitamins/minerals (unlike butter, which is _loaded_ with all kinds of goodies). So be careful: despite the squall of shilling on the net and in print, it's not health food. But it's tasty and not like lethally bad, so...<br />-------<br />Added on 12/18/2010: I'm half-way through the first jar, and I find myself using it less and less. It's too smelly, and I just don't have that much opportunity to use it for stuff where it's OK. Besides being food, it is supposedly also good for external use, for skin and hair; I haven't tried it this way (yet; maybe I will). But I have a feeling that _as food_ it doesn't have much of a future in this household: it's too overpowering, too particular.<br />-----<br />01/01/2011: Tried it for skin lotion: well, um, yes and no. No: it doesn't get absorbed into the skin, and the area of application stays greasy forever, so you can't do it before going out (even wiping with, say, paper towel, doesn't remove enough of it, so you'll stain the clothes with oil). Yes: it has a terrific staying power, hours and several hand washes after application there's still something remaining on the skin. And I work with my hands a lot, with the result that they tend to get real dirty, so I wash hands frequently and rather severely, the surgical way: very hot water, several soap-ups, brush. This causes severe dehydration of the skin, so I've always used hand lotion immediately after, but with coconut oil the skin remains slightly oiled, soft and moisturised even after a couple of such washes.<br /><br />So, finally: I'm not sure how (and whether) I'll continue to use coconut oil: I have definitely ceased to use it as food; as moisturiser we'll see... at least it's marginally cheaper than dry-skin cream so I'll give it a longer try. But the cream dries up in a minute, so it's more practicable, I must say. Doesn't smell of coconut either! :-) I must say I did not find the product as useful as it's hyped, so I'm taking one star off right now. I'll revisit in a month or two: if I discover by then that I've stopped using this thing altogether, I'll update the review to this effect.<br />--------<br />02/20/2011: Bottom line: I think I've settled into a two-sided routine with this oil: I use it, first, for light-frying/sauteing veggies (with yams or sweet potatoes as a basis; adding greens, like spinach, in the mix later on). I don't do this often though, 'cause I prefer to steam or eat raw, rather than fry anything; sauteing is quicker though, so when I'm pressed for time, this is workable. The other use is for skin: skin really loves this oil -- in addition to staying hydrated forever, it becomes very even in texture and colour; after shower I grease myself up, literally from head to toe, and it's just lovely (except for the clothes who get stained :-)."

Lemen,8,37,1,1312329600,Waste of my money.,"The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old.  At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil.  As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase."

I know about the risks of using plastic for storage, but at some point, a person has the draw the line.  My line has been drawn, and I've decided that coconut oil in plastic containers is A-OK by me.  If you have major concerns, I suppose that you could transfer it into a glass jar.

Taking 2 tablespoons of oil daily greatly helped in raising low body temperature, enabling a sluggish metabolism to be stabilized and facilitating weight loss.

It is not a panacea, but in combination with healthy diet and exercise it is a wonderful supplement.<br />  Before we had been buying this in the 54 oz jars, but these 15 oz tubs are so much more convenient to use and for travel -- and the price was lower!

This particular brand has a mild flavor, at least compared to other brands I've tried, and is very reasonably priced.  It is also very stable (keeps well) and is cold pressed virgin.  I used to get this at Wild Oats in Denver, CO to use for stir fries and sautees.  It makes an INCREDIBLE Thai style curry -- you use this oil to fry the spices and vegetables, then simmer everything in coconut milk.  You get several layers of coconut flavor this way.  Plus, this is one of the best oils you can consume *period*.  It is so rich in HDL and other good fats it'll scrub your arteries clean in a month.

I had been using almond oil, jojoba oil, all different kinds of body lotions, and castor/olive oil. NONE came close to being as brilliant as coconut oil!<br /><br />About me:<br /><br />*I am 20 yrs old, white/half-russian. My skin is acne-prone and a BIT on the dry-side. My skin doesn't tan or burn easily, and I am obsessed with anti-aging (I want to write a book on what worked and what didn't when I am older :D). I live in California, so the weather is rather neutral year-round.<br /><br />*What coconut oil has done for me:<br /><br />Coconut oil smells sooo nice and has a great texture -- depending on the weather it is either creamy and solid or silky and liquid. Being as affordable as it is, I can smear this all-over my body after showers and it will absorb within 30 minutes to an hour. My skin feels sooo soft and hydrated afterwards and it even helps my sunless tanners last longer! This stuff made my skin so soft that one day I wore cotton shorts from Hollister (so you can imagine, slightly baggy). It was a hot day, and after walking around outside for only around 45 minutes my upper thighs/bikini line were KILLING ME. When I went home I noticed the first layer of skin had rubbed off because it was SO soft!!! This was a bit annoying, so I cut-down on the amount of coconut oil I use...but that was like *Wow*<br />Also, my boyfriend constantly tells me how soft my skin is when I am using it *waiting for three more to arrive tomorrow!*<br /><br />Coconut oil is the best moisturizer EVER! I absolutely love this stuff and will continue using it forever! I still use castor oil every few weeks just for the healing properties (I think) and for my eyes/teeth/gums, but this stuff is sooo nice for my skin (and hair in small portions)!<br /><br />If you want a moisturizer that FINALLY gives the results you want, THIS IS IT!!! Five stars! :D"

Nutiva is great! It smells like fresh coconuts and has a very subtle coconut flavor. I use it to cook and as a body moisturizer. I don't do much deep frying, but I've sauteed shrimp and pan fried fish in this oil. Both turned out wonderfully with a slight coconut flavor which just made it all better for me. I have to agree with everyone that the plastic container is a let down, but I bought some small mason jars and put my oil in them. Works perfectly. That way I have a jar for the kitchen and one for the bath. Definitely try Nutiva if you're even a little curious about coconut oil. You won't be disappointed."

I suffer from psoriasis, and have been known to try anything to relieve it....well, you guessed it, the Coconut Oil was my next victim, and wow was I thrilled with the results.  It was soothing, moisturizing, and as a bonus, wonderfully aromatic.  After a couple weeks of continued use on my elbows, the results were really impressive.<br /><br />In addition to that, I have used it on my face, feet and hands as an overnight moisturizer, and it's doing wonders to my skin.  I also put some in a tiny tub to put on underneath lipstick (which can be so drying!).<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most obviously, it is delicious and healthy for cooking.  The only caveat I'll put here is that you definitely have to know ahead of time that the coconut smell is there.  There are some meals I just don't want to smell like coconut, so those I use my good old canola oil on.  But for chicken, with a little soy sauce, it is downright tropical, and I love it!

I don't worry about it spoiling because it has a much longer shelf life than other oils and a very high heat tolerance.  I use it for cooking mostly.  It is great on popcorn with sea salt, freshly baked bread, in stir frys and you can often use it in place of butter in many dishes.  I have a fabulous raw chocolate recipe that I make with it and give out as gifts.  After reading The Coconut Oil Miracle book by Bruce Fife I try to use coconut oil as much as I can.  It is anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  Truly a miracle food that is so healthy for you.<br /><br />I also use it on my hair when it needs a deep conditioning treatment.  Just leave it in overnight and wash out the next day and my hair is so shiny and soft afterwards and even feels a bit thicker.  It is great for your skin, especially if you feel like you are getting sick.  Just slather it on and let its amazing healing properties absorb into your blood stream via your skin.  I use it in smoothies to help my immune system as well.  And if I feel like I am coming down with something I will mix it with orange juice like is recommended in the Coconut Oil Miracle book.<br /><br />I also oil pull with it.  If you haven't read about oil pulling with coconut oil, you should.  It is a great teeth whitener among many other things including healing mouth sores.<br /><br />I really like the Nutiva brand because it tastes fresher than most. Very clean coconut flavor.

I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, ears and near my eyebrows and I have put the coconut oil on and left it on overnight (using a towel on my pillow because it is greasy) and the difference is amazing! I was given an Rx from my dermatologist (Luxiq Mouse - which is a steroid), but I don't like the idea of putting that on daily, as it thins out your skin.<br />I've tried lotions (cetaphil, eucerine, etc.) but I have never had an improvement like this.<br /><br />In addition to the seborrheic dermatitis, I have very dry skin. At the end of the day, if I'm wearing a dark-colored shirt, upon removal, the shirt is lined with skin flakes (gross, I know). But, since using this coconut oil, the flakes are GONE! It's truly unbelievable! Prior to receiving the coconut oil, I was washing with Cerave and using their lotion as well. While I noticed my skin didn't feel as ""tight"", I still had flakes. It wasn't until I mixed the coconut oil with the Cerave that the flakes disappeared.<br /><br />I also take 1 tbsp of coconut oil daily, with my breakfast.

The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor.  The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the flavored version.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0"">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVVJ6W"">32-oz glass - Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart</a>"

I started with a brand I purchased a local Hy-Vee because I wanted to try it out before I bought a more substantial amount. THe first buy was a refined coconut oil made by Spectrum. It worked well for what I used it for - nightly oil cleansing on my face, moisturizer and as an addition to my weekly deep conditioner for my hair...occasionally I'd spread some on toast. It worked out well, so i purchased ther Nutiva and was expecting a much better product than the Spectrum....it arrived yesterday and I was not disappointed. As soon as I opened it I could smell it - it smells and tastes AMAZING - just like fresh coconut. If you're not a fan of coconut, remember that this is not the smell/taste of sweetened, dried coconut or coconut fragrance...it smalls like actual coconut. I did my first oil cleanse with it last night and it seems slightly gritty at times, but nothing that is concerning to me. This is definitely a staple from now on!!"

189896,B001EO5Q64,A30ZWHKMYS67CM,LazyChick,3,3,5,1303516800,Great Stuff for a Number of Things,"I was almost put off using coconut oil entirely, after purchasing another brand (I think NOW was it, but different packaging). It came hard as a rock, yellow-looking and smelled pretty foul (almost sickly-sweet) - certainly nothing like coconut. I literally was chipping it out of the jar, and melting it was near impossible. Eventually, I realized that I was dealing with rancid oil, so it's pretty fortunate that I didn't use it all that often. Yuck.<br /><br />After watching a view Youtube videos for hair care, I noticed everyone's was white, creamy and you could easily scoop it out of the jar, so I decided to give it another shot and purchased Nutiva in February 2011. I'm so glad I did, too, because this stuff is great and for a number of things, some of which caught me off guard.<br /><br />- Cooking -<br />I enjoy cooking with it now and then, especially with my quick-fix quesadillas when I don't have time to cook anything else. However, it doesn't work on everything due to the subtle yet nutty flavor it can give, but I do like it for frying. Your place will smell like coconut when you fry with it, as a warning. I do love how fast it heats up, though.<br /><br />- Hair -<br />I originally intended to use this for hair and as a deep conditioning mask. I am biracial, with 3A/3b and a tinge of 3C hair. While I usually prefer to have it relaxed, I decided to give it a break due to lack of funds. The hard water we have here has been wreaking havoc on my hair and it's been in need of a trim for a while, but this stuff has greatly improved things, and it even can be used (lightly) to help tame frizz to some degree as a leave-in. My ringlets are back and the best-looking they've been since I can remember, and all I've been using since then is just Aphogee Green Tea spray, coconut oil and occasional argan oil.<br /><br />- Skin -<br />I consistently use this on my body and at night as skin cream. For the face, you only need a tiny, tiny amount. It also helps to tame down blemishes, which is a bonus, and leaves skin glowy. Last year or the year before, I also developed what looked like flesh-colored moles, which I thought were blemishes at first, but I can't be certain. Nothing I did would get rid of them though, until I started using the oil, which I found odd, but at least it worked! All in all, my skin has dramatically improved using this, with the help of some other products, and I don't feel I have to wear foundation.<br /><br />- Pets -<br />I give 1/2 tbls. to my cats and 1 tbls. to my dog a few times a week to help maintain their coats and keep their skin nice. It seems to be doing great and they've stopped driving me mental with scratching. I also tried it in hopes of helping my dog with her seizures. While it's not a drastic improvement, they have been fewer in between, which may or may not have a connection. I just mix it in their food maybe 2-3 days a week (ask your vet about how often, especially if they have health problems), and they love it. Even my female cat, who's picky about what she'll eat licks at the oil before she munches away.<br /><br />- Warts -<br />Short of the suspicious-looking things on my face at one point, I don't get moles, warts, or even freckles. However, I did get one whopping wart on the top of my big toe last year, which nothing would get rid of. I tried apple cider vinegar, wart patches and gels - you name it; I tried it. Not only did it hurt like crazy and work slowly, but it never got rid of it. All I did get was a scar and a lot of grief, only for it to return a few weeks later.<br /><br />When I started using coconut oil on the skin, I realized one day, like with my face, that my wart that had grown back was getting smaller. I kept watching it and finally realized the connection. I started using bandaids and applied a glob of oil on the spot before bed and then really started noticing results. This wart was the size of a chick pea (sorry to be gross lol), but now you can't see anything.<br /><br />I finally looked things up and realized that it was the acid in the oil that attacks lipid-coated virus cells, such as what's associated with HPV (warts), so I guess it makes sense. I was surprised though! I can tell due to the texture of the skin that it's not 100% gone (roots), but it still getting better and I'm not embarrassed anymore. It took about a month, but the more painful options took just as long and this is pain-free. So, it's something to try!<br /><br />Love this stuff and can't stop raving about it. I'm going to purchase more soon in this size to keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom again, plus a larger one for the mutts. The bathroom one still has plenty in it, despite me using it near-daily."

189903,B001EO5Q64,A1SEKOWUMXLWGJ,J. Berry,3,3,5,1282608000,I love this stuff!,"I have been having problems with my skin. The moisturizer I was using felt kind of scummy on my face after I added my foundation and I was having troubles with facial redness and dry patches. I was also having heat rash problems in my underarm area. I started using just a little of the coconut oil on my face in place of my moisturizer, then applying my foundation and wow! What a difference! My skin has cleared up and I love the soft smooth way my face feels. My foundation spreads and blends much better.  Also, the coconut oil really helps with the heat rash, immediately soothing the discomfort. I like using this as a hand cream too. I look forward to seeing how well it works this winter when the air is much drier.<br /><br />I have done a little cooking with it, but not enough yet to have an opinion.<br /><br />Other folks have mentioned that the oil leaked during shipment. I was concerned about this since I ordered it during the summer. I ordered 4 tubs (2 pks of 2 tubs). The plastic containers arrived packed in plastic bags, 2 tubs/bag, within the box. Even though the lids felt pretty tight on the tubs, both of the plastic bags had some coconut oil that had leaked, but not enough to feel cheated. A little oil leaked out of the plastic bags into the box, but they were the only things packed in the box so nothing was ruined. I can see that if the lids had been any looser though, there would have been a mess. Oil is hard to keep in a container with a wide mouth like this.<br /><br />One more thing...I absolutely love the smell of this stuff. It has a light roasted coconut essence which isn't too strong and doesn't linger overly long, but long enough to enjoy for a short while while it is being absorbed by the skin. Yum!"

After using it for just two days I noticed instant thickness in my hair.  I have it mixed with 3 parts EVCO, 2 parts EVOO, 1.5 part Vitamin E and 1.5 part hari oil with almond oils. I use it as a pre-shampoo treatment and twice daily."
189905,B001EO5Q64,A3JLPPCH32JRHZ,Msyaya,3,3,5,1274832000,S&S,"Excellent! I use this in EVERYTHING I cook, I use it in plain rice, fried rice, pasta, frying eggs anything. The flavoring is great and my house is always filled with the delicious aroma. Will try using it in my oil burner and on my skin but its perfect for my hair and leaves it shiny and silky. I have been using this for a few months and I am only halfway through one jar so a little goes a long long way! Excellent product!!"

206026,B004VLV7OM,AJ4N1F0LLV4F3,NoSpam,3,3,5,1319414400,My Favorite Hot Cereal!,"I LOVE this cereal. It's so much better than the one that has wheat in it. You get a nice corn grits flavor, along with all of the other delicious grains, and I like the grainy texture.<br />Plus it's fast and easy to make.  I just pour some about 1/3 way into a big mug, I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZMCO"">CorningWare 1035985 French White 20-Ounce Mug</a> (without the lid) add water to about an inch over the top of the cereal, stir, and nuke for about 2:30 min. in the microwave. Don't worry, there are directions on the bag for measurements, and cooking times...<br /><br />My current favorite way to eat it is to add a heaping Tbsp of (Not Dutch Process) Cocoa Powder (I usually get it at Trader Joes), a small handful of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY"">Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box</a>, a small handful of sliced almonds, some cinnamon, a pinch of salt (and/or anything else that sounds good at the time). Cook, stir, and top with some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a>, and any kind of milk (cow, soy, almond, hemp...). You'd think you were eating a decadent dessert instead of something healthy!<br /><br />Enjoy - you won't be disappointed!"
